Oh my God!

69
00:11:58,027 --> 00:11:59,857
- I got two guarding
the house.

70
00:11:59,926 --> 00:12:01,375
- Yeah? How's Ethan?

71
00:12:01,444 --> 00:12:04,275
- He'll be all right,
Teeter took him to the vet.

72
00:12:04,344 --> 00:12:05,897
- Where are the bodies at?

73
00:12:05,966 --> 00:12:07,485
- In my truck.

74
00:12:07,554 --> 00:12:09,659
- Well, get fuckin'
rid of 'em, Lloyd.

75
00:12:10,453 --> 00:12:12,455
- Right.

76
00:12:19,462 --> 00:12:22,327
- What's burning?

77
00:12:22,396 --> 00:12:25,089
- Sorry, Rip, I just...

78
00:12:25,158 --> 00:12:27,056
Didn't have the heart
to tell ya.

79
00:12:44,591 --> 00:12:45,765
- Let's go.

80
00:14:45,022 --> 00:14:46,644
- Indians.

81
00:14:46,713 --> 00:14:47,887
- Yeah.

82
00:14:47,956 --> 00:14:48,818
- Why aren't they on
the reservation?

83
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,130
- I don't know.

84
00:14:51,373 --> 00:14:53,306
- Do you know the way home?

85
00:14:56,757 --> 00:14:58,759
- All right.
Stay here.

86
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,352
- What do we do?

87
00:15:05,421 --> 00:15:07,907
- We do what he said.
We stay here.

88
00:15:34,623 --> 00:15:35,935
What do they want?

89
00:15:36,004 --> 00:15:37,660
- I don't know.

90
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:40,801
But they got a man at their camp
who speaks English.

91
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,424
- Do you trust them?

92
00:15:42,493 --> 00:15:45,599
- Son, I don't trust anyone.

93
00:15:45,668 --> 00:15:46,704
Till they've earned it.

94
00:15:48,016 --> 00:15:49,362
Y'all stay close to me.

95
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:05,240
- This your land now?

96
00:16:06,241 --> 00:16:08,346
- It is.

97
00:16:08,415 --> 00:16:09,934
- Used to be ours.

98
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:13,558
- I'm not the one
that took it from you.

99
00:16:13,627 --> 00:16:15,491
- Doesn't matter.
Still got took.

100
00:16:20,117 --> 00:16:21,532
- You here to try
to take it back?

101
00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:25,812
- Here to ask a favor.

102
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,264
- Ask.

103
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:32,612
- My father was born here.

104
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:37,306
This is where he'd like to rest.

105
00:16:39,619 --> 00:16:41,345
- So you want to bury him here?

106
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,280
- I want to put him in that tree

107
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,834
where the wolves
won't dig him up

108
00:16:47,903 --> 00:16:50,906
and he won't
spend the spring in the mud.

109
00:16:50,975 --> 00:16:52,218
Where relatives can come visit.

110
00:16:54,565 --> 00:16:59,328
He could find peace
in that tree a long time ago.

111
00:17:02,952 --> 00:17:06,163
Now there is no peace.

112
00:17:06,232 --> 00:17:09,062
Maybe you sell this land
or lose it to a bank.

113
00:17:10,857 --> 00:17:15,068
Then someone finds this tree
and scatters his bones.

114
00:17:15,137 --> 00:17:16,242
Steals his sacreds.

115
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:22,041
Then he has no peace forever.

116
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:31,567
So, I will bury him here
if you'll let me.

117
00:17:34,812 --> 00:17:37,056
- I'll let you.

118
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,265
Where do you want to bury him?

119
00:17:39,334 --> 00:17:43,027
- Someplace no one finds him.
You included.

120
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,446
- It's a long ride
from the reservation.

121
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,552
- Mm.

122
00:17:50,621 --> 00:17:51,622
Eight sleeps.

123
00:17:53,486 --> 00:17:55,039
- These horses look hungry.

124
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:57,490
- They are.

125
00:17:58,663 --> 00:17:59,699
- You look hungry too.

126
00:18:01,356 --> 00:18:02,840
- I'm used to being hungry.

127
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:07,500
- Yeah.

128
00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:10,572
It's been a hard winter.

129
00:18:10,641 --> 00:18:12,056
- All winters are hard.

130
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,644
This one...

131
00:18:13,713 --> 00:18:15,439
This one is punishment.

132
00:18:16,716 --> 00:18:18,200
- Your horses can graze here

133
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:21,859
while you choose a spot
for your father.

134
00:18:21,928 --> 00:18:23,619
I'll leave you a beef.

135
00:18:23,688 --> 00:18:25,380
Your family can graze, too.

136
00:18:25,449 --> 00:18:27,002
- Thank you.

137
00:18:28,969 --> 00:18:32,041
- Boys, let's push these cattle
out of here.

138
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,491
Cut out a steer for 'em,
all right?

139
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,254
- I'm sorry for you
being punished.

140
00:18:38,772 --> 00:18:39,911
- We are, too.

141
00:18:41,327 --> 00:18:42,742
- Come on.

142
00:18:48,023 --> 00:18:51,647
- Ya!

143
00:18:55,824 --> 00:18:56,894
Ya.

144
00:19:00,622 --> 00:19:01,830
Let's go, boys.

145
00:19:18,295 --> 00:19:19,434
Let's go, boys.

146
00:19:28,443 --> 00:19:30,790
- That's a disconnect code.

147
00:19:30,859 --> 00:19:32,481
- Dietician's in there?

148
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,517
- No one's in there.

149
00:19:35,829 --> 00:19:36,830
- Oh my God.

150
00:19:36,899 --> 00:19:39,212
Oh my God, no.

151
00:19:43,251 --> 00:19:45,770
- What is today?

152
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,739
- Thursday.

153
00:19:48,808 --> 00:19:50,154
- The month.

154
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:51,673
- August.

155
00:19:51,742 --> 00:19:53,295
- You need to lay down.

156
00:19:53,364 --> 00:19:54,538
- Been laying down long enough.

157
00:19:54,607 --> 00:19:55,987
- <i>We have a code three.
422 I.C.U.</i>

158
00:19:56,056 --> 00:19:57,644
- What's a code three?
- You are.

159
00:19:57,713 --> 00:19:59,198
- I'm not asking.

160
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:03,512
- Daddy.

161
00:20:09,346 --> 00:20:10,795
- What happened to you?

162
00:20:13,073 --> 00:20:14,627
- Same thing that
happened to you.

163
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:19,597
- Who else did it happen to?

164
00:20:20,771 --> 00:20:22,290
- Happened to all of us.

165
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:23,291
- Mr. Dutton, we need to get
you back to bed.

166
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,706
- Who did we lose?

167
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:27,536
- Define lose, Daddy.
- Who did we lose?

168
00:20:27,605 --> 00:20:28,813
- Get me some Persantine.

169
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:34,888
- All right, Mr. Dutton,
we're going to sit you down.

170
00:20:34,957 --> 00:20:37,408
Can I see your right hand?

171
00:20:37,477 --> 00:20:39,272
Got to put this
back in, okay?

172
00:20:45,174 --> 00:20:47,418
Mr. Dutton, count back from
a hundred for me, okay?

173
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,592
- What?
- 99.

174
00:20:48,661 --> 00:20:50,525
- What are you doing?
No, Dad. No!

175
00:20:50,594 --> 00:20:51,560
What are you doing?

176
00:20:51,629 --> 00:20:53,493
You tell me he'll never wake up

177
00:20:53,562 --> 00:20:55,426
and when he does you put
him back to fucking sleep?

178
00:20:55,495 --> 00:20:56,600
- If he has a blood clot,
and I can promise you he does,

179
00:20:56,669 --> 00:20:58,049
- Get your fucking hands off me!

180
00:20:58,118 --> 00:20:59,810
- Movement can dislodge
it and send it into his heart

181
00:20:59,879 --> 00:21:01,432
and then he woke up for nothing.
Let me do my--

182
00:21:01,501 --> 00:21:03,883
- Daddy!
- Let me do my job.

183
00:21:03,952 --> 00:21:06,195
Keep her out here
until I say otherwise.

184
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,326
- What happened to your face?

185
00:21:35,397 --> 00:21:37,641
- What happened to yours,
you insensitive little fuck?

186
00:21:38,987 --> 00:21:40,609
- Nothing happened to mine.

187
00:21:40,678 --> 00:21:42,784
- Yeah?
You should go find a mirror.

188
00:21:46,788 --> 00:21:47,823
- My dad's dying.

189
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,757
- So is mine.

190
00:21:52,552 --> 00:21:55,106
- What's killing yours?

191
00:21:55,175 --> 00:21:56,176
- Heroin.

192
00:21:57,937 --> 00:21:58,972
What's killing yours?

193
00:22:00,388 --> 00:22:02,321
- The Twenty-first century.

194
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:06,152
- You mean like... time?

195
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:11,985
- Yeah, something like that.

196
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:13,918
- How does time kill?

197
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:22,202
- With my family it sort of
takes the kitchen sink approach.

198
00:22:23,928 --> 00:22:25,723
- Don't know what that means.

199
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,138
- You need to study harder
in school, kid.

200
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,383
- I dropped out of school.

201
00:22:32,178 --> 00:22:33,628
- Why'd you do that?

202
00:22:34,663 --> 00:22:36,562
- Cause... Fuck it.

203
00:22:38,736 --> 00:22:40,359
- That's a winning attitude.

204
00:22:42,084 --> 00:22:43,327
Well,

205
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:45,191
the world needs
ditch diggers, too.

206
00:22:47,987 --> 00:22:49,333
- You got another one of those?

207
00:23:12,218 --> 00:23:13,322
You're pretty cool.

208
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:17,775
- Let's be honest, you're
probably going to be in jail

209
00:23:17,844 --> 00:23:20,744
in a few years.
What's a cigarette gonna hurt?

210
00:23:20,813 --> 00:23:22,262
- Why do you say that?

211
00:23:22,331 --> 00:23:23,402
- Because your
life is a mess

212
00:23:23,471 --> 00:23:25,024
and you're perfectly
fine with it

213
00:23:25,093 --> 00:23:28,130
because you've had
no one to admire.

214
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:30,305
No one to set an example.

215
00:23:30,374 --> 00:23:34,482
Now you're a lazy piece
of shit, right?

216
00:23:34,551 --> 00:23:37,346
But you're handsomish
and charming

217
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,314
and smart enough
to bullshit your way

218
00:23:39,383 --> 00:23:41,178
out of any trouble
you get into.

219
00:23:41,247 --> 00:23:43,594
But one day you are gonna find
yourself some trouble

220
00:23:43,663 --> 00:23:45,665
that you can't bullshit
your way out of.

221
00:23:47,943 --> 00:23:49,393
- You a therapist?

222
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:56,227
- I am the rock therapists
break themselves against.

223
00:23:57,781 --> 00:23:59,058
- You're pretty good at it.

224
00:24:00,646 --> 00:24:03,027
- Well, you're pretty
easy to analyze.

225
00:24:03,096 --> 00:24:05,513
I used to love guys like
you in high school.

226
00:24:05,582 --> 00:24:07,894
Give me a troubled loser
with blue eyes

227
00:24:07,963 --> 00:24:10,518
and I'd dry hump a hole
in his jeans.

228
00:24:10,587 --> 00:24:11,933
- What's dry hump?

229
00:24:14,522 --> 00:24:16,765
- How old are you?

230
00:24:16,834 --> 00:24:17,904
- 14.

231
00:24:17,973 --> 00:24:19,906
- Give me that
fucking cigarette.

232
00:24:20,942 --> 00:24:22,115
- The fuck?

233
00:24:24,877 --> 00:24:27,673
- Jesus, I thought you were 17.

234
00:24:27,742 --> 00:24:30,227
- You need to come inside.

235
00:24:30,296 --> 00:24:31,780
- Am I in trouble?

236
00:24:31,849 --> 00:24:33,748
- No, you're not in trouble.

237
00:24:35,577 --> 00:24:36,820
Are you a friend of the family?

238
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:42,826
- I guess I am now.

239
00:24:44,172 --> 00:24:45,725
- You should come, too.

240
00:24:50,454 --> 00:24:52,352
- Shit.

241
00:24:52,421 --> 00:24:53,699
- Yeah.

242
00:25:15,962 --> 00:25:19,552
- So when these lines
move vertically,

243
00:25:19,621 --> 00:25:23,418
it's reading the electrical
impulses of the brain.

244
00:25:23,487 --> 00:25:26,766
And when they level
in this manner here,

245
00:25:26,835 --> 00:25:28,147
it is displaying a--

246
00:25:28,216 --> 00:25:29,597
- Just tell him, dude.

247
00:25:33,117 --> 00:25:35,119
- Well, there's no
brain activity.

248
00:25:35,188 --> 00:25:37,812
The only thing keeping your
father alive is the machine.

249
00:25:40,228 --> 00:25:41,401
- What does that mean?

250
00:25:43,265 --> 00:25:44,957
- Well, the lack of brain
activity would suggest--

251
00:25:45,026 --> 00:25:47,442
- It means he's gone, honey.

252
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,723
Can he have some time
to say goodbye?

253
00:25:52,792 --> 00:25:54,069
- There's a protocol
we should discuss--

254
00:25:54,138 --> 00:25:55,174
- Yeah, no.
Not today there isn't.

255
00:25:55,243 --> 00:25:56,520
Get the fuck out.

256
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:58,798
Get the fuck out
so he can say goodbye.

257
00:26:20,855 --> 00:26:21,994
Don't know what to say.

258
00:26:24,962 --> 00:26:27,033
- Say whatever you feel.

259
00:26:28,069 --> 00:26:29,518
That's what you say.

260
00:26:36,525 --> 00:26:37,734
Fuck you.

261
00:26:39,459 --> 00:26:43,084
Fuck you for leaving
me in this place

262
00:26:43,153 --> 00:26:45,742
with nothing and nobody.

263
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,850
If there's a hell,
you're in it

264
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:55,061
And I'll see you
when I get there.

265
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,791
Son of a bitch.

266
00:27:11,837 --> 00:27:13,217
- That was a good speech.

267
00:27:16,186 --> 00:27:17,359
I like your style.

268
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,776
- I don't have a style.

269
00:27:22,157 --> 00:27:23,331
- Yeah, you do.

270
00:27:55,052 --> 00:27:56,019
- Hit me.

271
00:27:56,088 --> 00:27:57,054
Come on now.

272
00:27:59,229 --> 00:28:01,818
Come on, come on now, baby.
Woo hoo!

273
00:28:01,887 --> 00:28:03,026
- Blackjack.

274
00:28:04,579 --> 00:28:06,063
- Come to papa.

275
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,722
Mm! There you go.

276
00:28:09,791 --> 00:28:12,173
- Big spender.

277
00:28:12,242 --> 00:28:13,795
- You're welcome.

278
00:28:16,073 --> 00:28:17,040
Hey.

279
00:28:18,351 --> 00:28:21,147
Hey.

280
00:28:21,216 --> 00:28:24,461
I tip you every time I win
and all I been doing is winning.

281
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:27,119
The least you can say
is thank you.

282
00:28:27,188 --> 00:28:28,707
- Thank you.

283
00:28:28,776 --> 00:28:30,225
- You're welcome.

284
00:28:34,402 --> 00:28:37,439
Ungrateful motherfuckers, man.

285
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:40,166
We give you casinos,
free college,

286
00:28:40,235 --> 00:28:42,755
free fucking medical care.

287
00:28:42,824 --> 00:28:44,412
Don't know what
else you people want.

288
00:28:44,481 --> 00:28:47,864
- Gee, I don't know...
Maybe our land back?

289
00:28:47,933 --> 00:28:51,799
Think you can MacGyver
that up for us, Wasichu?

290
00:28:51,868 --> 00:28:53,076
- What's that mean?

291
00:28:53,145 --> 00:28:54,318
- Ain't a compliment.

292
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,357
- You fucking people.

293
00:28:58,426 --> 00:29:00,669
Take, take, take, take,
take, take, take.

294
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,085
Hey.

295
00:29:02,154 --> 00:29:03,293
I've done more to
get your land back

296
00:29:03,362 --> 00:29:04,881
than anybody in
the past century.

297
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,986
- We don't have our land back.
John Dutton has our land.

298
00:29:07,055 --> 00:29:08,470
- Yeah, and where's he at?

299
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:11,232
Rotting in a fucking bed,
waiting to die.

300
00:29:11,301 --> 00:29:13,786
So, you know.
You're welcome.

301
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,377
- Are you saying
you shot John Dutton?

302
00:29:18,446 --> 00:29:19,827
- I'm just a
party planner, baby.

303
00:29:19,896 --> 00:29:21,311
I just put people together.

304
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,831
What they do
is what they do...

305
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,730
And what they did
was clear your land.

306
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,283
You want it back?

307
00:29:28,352 --> 00:29:32,046
Stop your bitching, deal me
cards or go fucking get it.

308
00:29:47,889 --> 00:29:49,373
Woo!

309
00:29:52,652 --> 00:29:53,861
Meter maid?

310
00:29:54,931 --> 00:29:56,277
- Excuse me, sir.

311
00:29:56,346 --> 00:29:57,899
Could we speak to
you for a moment?

312
00:30:03,422 --> 00:30:04,561
- Speak.

313
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:08,876
You gonna speak, fucking spea--

314
00:30:16,021 --> 00:30:17,401
- Sorry for the intrusion.

315
00:30:25,685 --> 00:30:26,963
- So who is he?

316
00:30:27,032 --> 00:30:28,447
- His name is Chester Spears.

317
00:30:28,516 --> 00:30:30,242
Dishonorable discharge
from the Army

318
00:30:30,311 --> 00:30:33,176
in 2006 for conduct unbecoming.

319
00:30:33,245 --> 00:30:35,419
Did three years in
Rock Springs for robbery.

320
00:30:35,488 --> 00:30:39,113
Another five years in Red Lodge
for aggravated assault.

321
00:30:39,182 --> 00:30:41,184
Has arrests for check fraud,

322
00:30:41,253 --> 00:30:44,532
wire fraud,
two DUI convictions.

323
00:30:44,601 --> 00:30:46,603
- TheGreat White Hopeless.

324
00:30:46,672 --> 00:30:49,295
Why am I looking at him?

325
00:30:49,364 --> 00:30:50,987
- He said he knows
who hit the Duttons.

326
00:30:51,056 --> 00:30:52,678
Bragged about
putting it together.

327
00:30:55,577 --> 00:30:58,753
- Putting it together?

328
00:30:58,822 --> 00:31:01,480
Ask him if he knows
who killed Kennedy.

329
00:31:01,549 --> 00:31:03,102
Probably tell you
he planned that, too.

330
00:31:05,346 --> 00:31:07,831
He's a drug dealer, Mo.
At best.

331
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,213
- Drug dealers don't
gamble wads like this.

332
00:31:10,282 --> 00:31:11,697
Can't afford to lose it.

333
00:31:12,698 --> 00:31:14,527
- He didn't win that?

334
00:31:14,596 --> 00:31:17,116
- These are his winnings.

335
00:31:23,364 --> 00:31:26,574
- See if you can help him
separate fantasy from reality.

336
00:31:28,403 --> 00:31:31,717
- How much pressure
before we let him cry uncle?

337
00:31:31,786 --> 00:31:33,443
- What they did
to John Dutton

338
00:31:33,512 --> 00:31:37,033
hasn't been done since
they did it to us.

339
00:31:37,102 --> 00:31:40,174
We need to know who's
trying to take his land

340
00:31:40,243 --> 00:31:42,176
because they're coming
after ours next.

341
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,662
No uncles for that one.

342
00:31:46,766 --> 00:31:47,906
- Okay.

343
00:31:50,115 --> 00:31:53,739
- But tradition,
I won't abandon.

344
00:31:55,085 --> 00:31:57,777
Do it the way we used to do it.

345
00:31:57,846 --> 00:32:00,470
Do it the way our grandfathers
did it.

346
00:32:09,444 --> 00:32:11,515
- Motherfucker!
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

347
00:32:11,584 --> 00:32:12,896
I know your face!

348
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:14,208
I know your fucking face!

349
00:32:14,277 --> 00:32:15,416
You can't fucking do this!

350
00:32:15,485 --> 00:32:16,831
- Why not?

351
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,902
You've been doing it to us
for five hundred years.

352
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:20,559
- Then kill me, motherfucker!

353
00:32:20,628 --> 00:32:22,285
Go on and kill me, then!

354
00:32:22,354 --> 00:32:24,735
Spend the rest of your
fucking life in a prison cell

355
00:32:24,804 --> 00:32:27,600
until they shoot bleach
in your veins

356
00:32:27,669 --> 00:32:30,431
and you piss yourself on
your way to fucking hell!

357
00:32:34,883 --> 00:32:37,714
- My mother was killed
by two white men

358
00:32:37,783 --> 00:32:41,166
who offered her a ride
when her car ran out of gas.

359
00:32:41,235 --> 00:32:43,651
I sat strapped
in a car seat for three days

360
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,791
before someone found me.

361
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,173
Hell is all I've ever known.

362
00:32:52,901 --> 00:32:54,386
- What are you doing?

363
00:32:54,455 --> 00:32:55,697
What are you fucking doing?

364
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:56,940
We can talk about it.

365
00:33:18,513 --> 00:33:19,859
- So, you're the party planner.

366
00:33:21,482 --> 00:33:23,656
Tell me about this party
you planned for John Dutton.

367
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:29,179
- I'm hurt here, man.
You really hurt--

368
00:33:29,248 --> 00:33:30,767
- Now you're hurt.

369
00:33:32,631 --> 00:33:34,633
Tell me about this party.

370
00:33:34,702 --> 00:33:37,567
Who wanted you to plan it?

371
00:33:37,636 --> 00:33:39,500
- If I tell you I'm a dead man.

372
00:33:39,569 --> 00:33:41,053
- You're already a dead man.

373
00:33:41,122 --> 00:33:43,193
Only question is how.

374
00:33:47,301 --> 00:33:49,130
- I don't wanna
fucking die, man.

375
00:33:49,199 --> 00:33:50,649
I don't wanna fucking die.

376
00:33:50,718 --> 00:33:51,960
- You a father?

377
00:33:53,548 --> 00:33:54,825
Love them?

378
00:33:59,899 --> 00:34:02,178
We're at war, you and me.

379
00:34:02,247 --> 00:34:05,767
When you die, I take the war
to your family.

380
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:08,908
Stop thinking about yourself.

381
00:34:08,977 --> 00:34:10,945
Think about your family,

382
00:34:11,014 --> 00:34:13,051
and tell me something
that will save them.

383
00:34:35,003 --> 00:34:36,729
- Lloyd!

384
00:34:45,048 --> 00:34:47,292
Take Jake and Ethan
and head out to pasture nine.

385
00:34:47,361 --> 00:34:49,742
Start moving them heifers.

386
00:34:49,811 --> 00:34:52,366
- Three guys and
you're going to take seven

387
00:34:52,435 --> 00:34:53,643
to doctor these few cows.

388
00:34:53,712 --> 00:34:55,127
- Lloyd, the boss
is coming home today,

389
00:34:55,196 --> 00:34:56,301
and I want people around.

390
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:58,682
You keep that between you and I.
Go on.

391
00:34:58,751 --> 00:35:01,444
- Jake, Ethan, you're with me.
Come on.

392
00:35:06,138 --> 00:35:07,174
- All right, come on.

393
00:35:07,243 --> 00:35:09,176
Colby, Teeter, Walker, let's go.

394
00:35:15,527 --> 00:35:16,666
Back

395
00:35:18,392 --> 00:35:19,496
There you go.

396
00:35:22,499 --> 00:35:25,468
I can do--
I can do this myself.

397
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,439
Didn't think I was going
to make it, did you?

398
00:35:31,508 --> 00:35:33,579
- Never doubted it for a second.

399
00:35:33,648 --> 00:35:35,857
- Yeah. Liar.

400
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:37,480
- Everyone else doubted.

401
00:35:37,549 --> 00:35:39,413
Not me. Not once.

402
00:35:41,863 --> 00:35:43,934
- I can...

403
00:35:44,003 --> 00:35:46,074
- We need you to lay down.

404
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,179
- I know the drill.

405
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,681
Yeah.

406
00:36:17,451 --> 00:36:20,764
How's the ranch?

407
00:36:20,833 --> 00:36:23,388
- We'll talk about the ranch
when we get there.

408
00:36:27,115 --> 00:36:30,015
- Good. Okay, let's try
the other side.

409
00:36:34,157 --> 00:36:35,193
- Stop.

410
00:36:37,229 --> 00:36:38,817
Back up.

411
00:36:45,617 --> 00:36:46,894
- Great.

412
00:36:47,929 --> 00:36:49,483
Oh, it's almost massage time.

413
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,555
Then a bath.

414
00:36:53,935 --> 00:36:55,282
- What happened to him?

415
00:36:55,351 --> 00:36:57,732
<i>Dr. Plunkett,
Dr. Plunkett.</i>

416
00:36:57,801 --> 00:37:01,184
- It's on the list of things
we need to discuss.

417
00:37:01,253 --> 00:37:02,289
- A list of things.

418
00:37:02,358 --> 00:37:04,808
- A long list, Daddy.

419
00:37:04,877 --> 00:37:06,258
Come on.

420
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,479
- All this for us?

421
00:37:20,548 --> 00:37:22,343
- I'll see you at the house.

422
00:37:22,412 --> 00:37:23,379
- All right, you don't
want to ride

423
00:37:23,448 --> 00:37:24,621
in this piece of shit anyway.

424
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:26,830
Can we turn these
flashing lights off?

425
00:37:26,899 --> 00:37:28,832
Hey.

426
00:37:28,901 --> 00:37:29,902
Hey...

427
00:37:31,145 --> 00:37:33,043
All right, come here.

428
00:37:53,512 --> 00:37:55,514
- He's coming in!

429
00:38:48,395 --> 00:38:50,914
- One, two, three.

430
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:07,241
- All right, I can walk
from here.

431
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:09,139
Ow, God damn it.

432
00:39:09,208 --> 00:39:11,245
- Put him down.

433
00:39:11,314 --> 00:39:13,765
- I didn't get shot in my damn
legs, for hell's sake...

434
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,423
Okay.

435
00:39:16,492 --> 00:39:18,148
Now what you going
to do, smarty?

436
00:39:18,217 --> 00:39:19,460
- Two, three.

437
00:39:22,221 --> 00:39:24,569
This is more fucking
dangerous than walking.

438
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,715
No.
No, no.

439
00:39:32,784 --> 00:39:34,441
- Dad, you wanted to come home,

440
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,546
this is what they
required to release you.

441
00:39:36,615 --> 00:39:38,306
- I'm released now, all right?

442
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,860
Their requirements,
they don't matter.

443
00:39:39,929 --> 00:39:41,689
Get all this shit out of here.

444
00:39:41,758 --> 00:39:42,725
- Sir, we're required
to provide you

445
00:39:42,794 --> 00:39:43,829
with the same standard of care

446
00:39:43,898 --> 00:39:46,004
that you received
in the hospital.

447
00:39:46,073 --> 00:39:48,386
- Beth, get all this
shit out of here.

448
00:39:48,455 --> 00:39:49,801
I...

449
00:39:58,465 --> 00:40:00,777
Oh, God, no.
Let me do it.

450
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:06,162
- He's got it.

451
00:40:06,231 --> 00:40:07,197
- There. You comfortable?

452
00:40:07,266 --> 00:40:09,717
- No.

453
00:40:09,786 --> 00:40:12,720
- Okay, he is all yours.
Have fun.

454
00:40:14,964 --> 00:40:17,622
- I'm Maggie.
I'm here to take care of you.

455
00:40:19,727 --> 00:40:22,350
You need anything,
just give that a little press.

456
00:40:23,628 --> 00:40:25,319
Okay, we'll have lunch
in a couple hours

457
00:40:25,388 --> 00:40:27,321
and then we'll get you bathed,
how does that sound?

458
00:40:33,603 --> 00:40:35,225
- Just get some rest.
- Mm-hmm.

459
00:40:37,089 --> 00:40:38,090
- Please.

460
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,339
Oh, Mister Dutton!
No, no, no.

461
00:41:20,408 --> 00:41:21,824
No, go back to your room.

462
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,897
Maggie...

463
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:28,831
You're fired.

464
00:41:43,362 --> 00:41:44,571
- I think you should
stay in the lodge

465
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,504
until I figure this thing out.

466
00:41:50,231 --> 00:41:54,995
- We've, uh... moved
into the Foreman's house.

467
00:41:55,064 --> 00:41:58,343
- Good. Good.
Cabin's too remote.

468
00:42:05,557 --> 00:42:06,731
- Cabin's gone, Daddy.

469
00:42:09,147 --> 00:42:10,873
They decided to kill that, too.

470
00:42:14,566 --> 00:42:16,085
- What...

471
00:42:17,155 --> 00:42:18,708
What else...

472
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:22,712
What else did
they decide to kill?

473
00:42:25,059 --> 00:42:26,095
- You're home.

474
00:42:27,924 --> 00:42:31,134
I'd like to end
this day on a victory.

475
00:42:31,203 --> 00:42:33,171
We'll talk defeat tomorrow.

476
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,590
- What are you hunting?

477
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,766
- Whatever's hunting us.

478
00:43:20,528 --> 00:43:22,461
- No one will talk to me.

479
00:43:24,187 --> 00:43:25,879
Nobody will tell me
what happened.

480
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:28,985
- I don't have the heart.

481
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,407
They came after all of us.

482
00:43:39,547 --> 00:43:40,583
But we beat them.

483
00:43:42,309 --> 00:43:43,310
- All of them?

484
00:43:45,484 --> 00:43:46,589
- Every one they sent.

485
00:43:50,144 --> 00:43:53,423
- Well, you haven't got anything
until you get the sender, son.

486
00:43:53,492 --> 00:43:55,667
- Yeah.
Don't know the sender.

487
00:43:57,462 --> 00:43:59,084
- That's what
we figure out next.

488
00:43:59,153 --> 00:44:00,465
- Yeah.

489
00:44:15,998 --> 00:44:17,585
Goddamn, why does it feel like
the whole

490
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,001
fucking ranch is on fire?

491
00:44:20,761 --> 00:44:22,314
- Burning brush piles.

492
00:44:22,383 --> 00:44:24,144
- Why are we
burning brush piles?

493
00:44:27,492 --> 00:44:28,666
- We ain't burning them, Dad.

494
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,586
- Smart bird.

495
00:44:58,488 --> 00:45:00,836
- It's not an annexation issue,
it's a formation issue,

496
00:45:00,905 --> 00:45:04,494
and it's really a county
issue at this point, so...

497
00:45:04,563 --> 00:45:06,600
I would wait until
the development is built.

498
00:45:06,669 --> 00:45:09,120
Why incur the
added regulations?

499
00:45:09,189 --> 00:45:10,328
Uh-huh.

500
00:45:12,813 --> 00:45:14,608
Roarke, I'll have
to call you back.

501
00:45:17,438 --> 00:45:18,543
Let her in.

502
00:45:37,389 --> 00:45:40,047
- Could I have a moment alone
with my brother, please?

503
00:45:47,227 --> 00:45:51,990
So, we, uh... we had to clear
out your room.

504
00:45:52,059 --> 00:45:55,131
You know, for Daddy's
hospice bed, and I found...

505
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,443
It's so cute.

506
00:45:56,512 --> 00:46:01,517
It reminded me of when
you were just a wee lad.

507
00:46:01,586 --> 00:46:02,587
- Son of a bitch...

508
00:46:02,656 --> 00:46:04,382
- No, that wasn't it.

509
00:46:04,451 --> 00:46:06,764
It was this...

510
00:46:10,043 --> 00:46:11,458
Look me in the fucking eyes.

511
00:46:11,527 --> 00:46:13,563
- You're fucking crazy
and I will have you arrested.

512
00:46:13,632 --> 00:46:16,049
- I've waited two months
for this moment, Jamie.

513
00:46:16,118 --> 00:46:19,880
Two months of praying
and bartering with God

514
00:46:19,949 --> 00:46:21,330
for his survival.

515
00:46:21,399 --> 00:46:22,780
And guess what?

516
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:27,163
He did survive.

517
00:46:27,232 --> 00:46:28,820
I thought you'd like
to know that seeing as

518
00:46:28,889 --> 00:46:30,339
you never visited once.

519
00:46:30,408 --> 00:46:32,513
You never called once.

520
00:46:32,582 --> 00:46:35,413
- I called every day.
I just didn't call you.

521
00:46:40,349 --> 00:46:41,695
- It was you, wasn't it?

522
00:46:44,663 --> 00:46:46,596
- It was me what?

523
00:46:53,086 --> 00:46:54,363
- I want to tell you something.

524
00:46:56,675 --> 00:46:59,161
And it's for me,
it's not for you...

525
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:02,095
See I want you to know it now,
so you can think about it...

526
00:47:05,029 --> 00:47:08,964
and not sleep
and worry and dread.

527
00:47:14,176 --> 00:47:15,384
I'm going to kill you.

528
00:47:17,317 --> 00:47:21,321
But when I do it, I'm not
going to farm it out like you,

529
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:22,770
you fucking coward.

530
00:47:24,496 --> 00:47:26,498
I'm going to do it myself.

531
00:47:26,567 --> 00:47:28,086
- You think that I would--

532
00:47:28,155 --> 00:47:29,950
- I'm going to kill you, Jamie.

533
00:47:30,019 --> 00:47:33,402
I'm going to fucking kill you
for what you did to my family.

534
00:47:33,471 --> 00:47:34,748
- Think very hard about
what you're saying,

535
00:47:34,817 --> 00:47:36,129
you are threatening
a state official.

536
00:47:36,198 --> 00:47:38,476
- I am threatening
the whole fucking state.

537
00:48:29,044 --> 00:48:30,424
- No picnic working here, huh?

538
00:48:36,085 --> 00:48:37,638
I'm here to say I'm sorry.

539
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:42,747
And I'm here to say thank you.

540
00:48:42,816 --> 00:48:44,991
I'm sorry people came
after you to get to me.

541
00:48:47,821 --> 00:48:49,236
That's not what you
signed up for.

542
00:48:49,305 --> 00:48:50,479
I'm sorry you...

543
00:48:52,067 --> 00:48:53,033
I'm sorry you went
through that.

544
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:56,795
Now to thank you.

545
00:48:56,864 --> 00:48:59,902
And I mean it from

546
00:49:02,663 --> 00:49:04,182
thank you for fighting back.

547
00:49:07,185 --> 00:49:09,912
Thank you for
protecting this place,

548
00:49:09,981 --> 00:49:11,431
and protecting my family.

549
00:49:14,123 --> 00:49:15,193
I'll never forget it.

550
00:49:18,403 --> 00:49:21,303
Now you, uh...

551
00:49:21,372 --> 00:49:22,960
you stop worrying
about fighting.

552
00:49:25,341 --> 00:49:27,136
Worry about cowboying.
You leave the...

553
00:49:29,518 --> 00:49:30,968
You leave the fighting to me.

554
00:49:34,661 --> 00:49:38,492
Good Lord, looks like you boys
could use some beer, huh?

555
00:49:38,561 --> 00:49:40,598
Hmm.

556
00:49:40,667 --> 00:49:42,186
Oh my goodness.

557
00:49:49,227 --> 00:49:50,746
- You all right to drink, boss?

558
00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:55,716
- Lloyd, I've come to the
conclusion that the only thing

559
00:49:55,785 --> 00:49:59,134
on this earth that
can kill me is me.

560
00:50:00,411 --> 00:50:01,757
Any of you dipshits
feel like

561
00:50:01,826 --> 00:50:04,104
losing a weeks' wages
to the boss?

562
00:50:14,908 --> 00:50:18,601
Can someone explain to me how
this whole deal is working out?

563
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:21,121
- Oh, that.

564
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:24,262
Well, that's what you'd call
a constant state of evolution.

565
00:50:24,331 --> 00:50:28,542
- Well, look at the big
words from Jake.

566
00:50:28,611 --> 00:50:30,096
- Are we playing Hold 'Em?

567
00:50:30,165 --> 00:50:32,926
- We can play anything you
want to lose your money to.

568
00:50:32,995 --> 00:50:36,585
- Just to let you know,
when we play cards we like to...

569
00:50:36,654 --> 00:50:37,827
talk a lot of trash,

570
00:50:37,896 --> 00:50:39,208
so don't get your feelings
hurt, all right?

571
00:50:39,277 --> 00:50:40,658
- If one of you boys think
you can insult me,

572
00:50:40,727 --> 00:50:42,142
give it your best shot.

573
00:50:42,211 --> 00:50:43,661
- Don't mind if I do.

574
00:50:46,181 --> 00:50:48,528
- Alright.
The game's Hold 'Em.

575
00:50:51,496 --> 00:50:52,808
Three, six, king.

576
00:50:56,122 --> 00:50:57,606
- Got it.

577
00:51:14,174 --> 00:51:16,452
- Could you point me
to the restroom?

578
00:51:16,521 --> 00:51:18,592
- Yeah, it's just down
the hallway and to the right.

579
00:51:18,661 --> 00:51:21,181
- I'm going to go first.
Get me a beer.

580
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,295
- Women.

581
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:34,539
- Excuse me?

582
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,542
- I said "women."

583
00:51:40,856 --> 00:51:42,029
- What about us?

584
00:51:44,066 --> 00:51:46,413
- Life is perspective
and you don't have any.

585
00:51:48,519 --> 00:51:50,003
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

586
00:51:50,072 --> 00:51:52,454
- I'm talking about your husband
leaving you here at the bar

587
00:51:52,523 --> 00:51:55,491
to buy him a drink
and do Kiegel exercises

588
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:58,908
while he goes and
powders his nose...

589
00:51:58,977 --> 00:52:00,772
when it should be
the other way around.

590
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:07,503
- Why...should it be
the other way around?

591
00:52:10,299 --> 00:52:13,095
- Because you have all the pussy
and half the money.

592
00:52:14,821 --> 00:52:15,856
That's why.

593
00:52:21,759 --> 00:52:22,725
- I never thought
of it like that.

594
00:52:22,794 --> 00:52:23,899
- Mm-hmm...

595
00:52:25,521 --> 00:52:26,936
It's perspective.

596
00:52:31,596 --> 00:52:32,735
- Where's your man?

597
00:52:34,806 --> 00:52:37,361
- He's on our porch
waiting for me to get home.

598
00:52:38,879 --> 00:52:41,330
- Why aren't you?

599
00:52:41,399 --> 00:52:42,607
- Because I'm in a bad mood.

600
00:52:44,644 --> 00:52:46,163
I don't like to take those home.

601
00:52:48,924 --> 00:52:49,925
- Where's my beer?

602
00:52:51,375 --> 00:52:53,963
- Order your own fucking beer.

603
00:52:54,032 --> 00:52:56,414
And get me a
skinny margarita with Tito's.

604
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:06,252
- Oh, that cheered me up.

605
00:53:32,347 --> 00:53:33,934
Mmm...

606
00:53:39,354 --> 00:53:41,252
Oh...

607
00:53:42,288 --> 00:53:43,772
- Can't you just sleep in?

608
00:53:45,291 --> 00:53:46,602
- Not today, sweetie.

609
00:53:50,848 --> 00:53:52,505
- Are you telling me no?

610
00:53:54,507 --> 00:53:56,440
- Got something I need
to take care of.

611
00:54:04,862 --> 00:54:06,139
- Damn right, you do.

612
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:12,628
You know, it's faster
just to fuck me

613
00:54:12,697 --> 00:54:15,735
than argue about fucking me
then still fucking me.

614
00:54:17,737 --> 00:54:20,015
Sweetheart, you don't know
what I have to do.

615
00:54:23,087 --> 00:54:24,226
- Something bad?

616
00:54:26,504 --> 00:54:29,473
- Yeah. Something bad.

617
00:54:31,992 --> 00:54:33,304
- More reason, then.

618
00:55:01,505 --> 00:55:02,471
- Excuse me.

619
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:05,371
This yours?

620
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,544
- What?

621
00:55:06,613 --> 00:55:08,857
- Found it up here on the bank.

622
00:55:08,926 --> 00:55:11,411
- It's not mine, man.

623
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,964
- Not yours, huh?

624
00:55:13,033 --> 00:55:14,172
You sure?

625
00:55:15,864 --> 00:55:17,072
- I said it's not mine.

626
00:55:17,141 --> 00:55:18,176
What the hell
are you doing?

627
00:55:18,245 --> 00:55:20,765
- You sure it's not yours?
Huh?

628
00:55:20,834 --> 00:55:21,835
A little present
from the Yellowstone.

629
00:55:21,904 --> 00:55:23,389
- What? No!

630
00:55:23,458 --> 00:55:24,459
Ah!

631
00:56:03,912 --> 00:56:05,741
- Shouldn't be long now.

632
00:56:15,993 --> 00:56:17,477
Good riddance.
