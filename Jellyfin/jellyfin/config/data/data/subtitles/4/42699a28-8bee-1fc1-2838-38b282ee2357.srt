- Horse owner?

25
00:02:40,056 --> 00:02:41,678
- The Yellowstone.

26
00:02:41,678 --> 00:02:43,577
- Do you call it the Yellowstone
or the Dutton Ranch?

27
00:02:43,577 --> 00:02:45,095
I have both here.

28
00:02:45,095 --> 00:02:47,236
- I think it's technically
the Yellowstone Dutton Ranch,

29
00:02:47,236 --> 00:02:49,514
but everyone just
calls it the Yellowstone.

30
00:02:49,514 --> 00:02:51,171
- When your horses show
like that

31
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,413
you can call it
whatever you want.

32
00:02:56,245 --> 00:02:57,418
Sign here that you
received them.

33
00:02:57,418 --> 00:02:59,386
- Yeah.

34
00:02:59,386 --> 00:03:00,490
Wow.

35
00:03:03,631 --> 00:03:06,151
Actually, can you just
mail those to the ranch?

36
00:03:06,151 --> 00:03:07,808
- Sure, to the address
I have on file?

37
00:03:07,808 --> 00:03:09,223
- Yeah. I'm sure it's fine.

38
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,779
As long as you're mailing 'em,

39
00:03:13,779 --> 00:03:16,023
if I wrote a little letter,
could you send that, too?

40
00:03:16,023 --> 00:03:17,162
- You bet.

41
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,269
- Oh, thanks.
- You're welcome.

42
00:03:59,825 --> 00:04:01,413
There you go.

43
00:04:01,413 --> 00:04:03,035
- Thank you.

44
00:04:04,658 --> 00:04:05,728
- How's that letter coming?

45
00:04:07,695 --> 00:04:10,905
- Ah... No letter. Just, uh...

46
00:04:10,905 --> 00:04:12,597
Just mail the checks. Thanks.

47
00:05:57,805 --> 00:05:59,428
- Get skunked again?

48
00:05:59,428 --> 00:06:00,877
- No, sir.

49
00:06:00,877 --> 00:06:02,120
First one here today.

50
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:04,536
- Good for you.

51
00:06:09,299 --> 00:06:10,266
- Morning.

52
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:12,372
- Morning.

53
00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:16,824
- Where to today?

54
00:06:16,824 --> 00:06:18,205
- The rock.

55
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,139
- So, what happened?

56
00:06:24,211 --> 00:06:25,419
- We got a lot to talk about.

57
00:06:39,053 --> 00:06:41,401
- We got so much to talk
about, why aren't we talking?

58
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,681
- This is where my father died.

59
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,200
Did you know that?

60
00:06:50,824 --> 00:06:52,481
It's where I asked
your mother to marry me

61
00:06:52,481 --> 00:06:55,898
and where I buried her ring
somewhere around here.

62
00:06:58,038 --> 00:06:59,833
Should've thought that one
through a little better.

63
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:02,180
I'd like to...

64
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,250
I'd like to have that back.

65
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,290
You know, our cemetery may
be by the river, son,

66
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:12,811
this is our graveyard.

67
00:07:33,522 --> 00:07:35,178
- Who's this?

68
00:07:35,178 --> 00:07:38,423
- That's the man hired
to kill us.

69
00:07:38,423 --> 00:07:39,666
- Hired by who?

70
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,461
- That's the question.

71
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,601
- Where is he?

72
00:07:43,601 --> 00:07:46,224
- Prison.
In Red Lodge.

73
00:07:46,224 --> 00:07:48,882
You need to ask your brother
for his prison records.

74
00:07:48,882 --> 00:07:51,643
Have him set an interview
with you and the Sheriff.

75
00:07:51,643 --> 00:07:53,473
If he balks....

76
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,614
If he stalls,
if he resists in any way...

77
00:07:58,547 --> 00:07:59,824
Then we have our answer.

78
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:04,380
- I just don't think Jamie
could ever do it, Dad.

79
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,659
Beth has everybody so
twisted up about who he is...

80
00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:09,523
Why don't you just
ask him, yourself, Dad?

81
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:11,767
Why don't you two just sit
in a room and figure it out?

82
00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:13,078
- I can't sit in a room with him

83
00:08:13,078 --> 00:08:14,701
until we have
an answer for this.

84
00:08:16,254 --> 00:08:17,738
No matter what the answer is.

85
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:24,469
- Okay.
I'll go see him today.

86
00:08:26,989 --> 00:08:28,577
- What's going on
with your family, son?

87
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,546
Haven't seen 'em in weeks.

88
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:34,203
Just hide out in that room.

89
00:08:36,619 --> 00:08:39,277
- They were, uh,

90
00:08:39,277 --> 00:08:40,623
they were in
the house when it happened.

91
00:08:41,693 --> 00:08:44,765
So... I don't know...

92
00:08:44,765 --> 00:08:45,904
I guess that's where
they feel safe.

93
00:08:48,873 --> 00:08:51,323
Well, you...

94
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:52,324
You gotta fix that.

95
00:08:53,671 --> 00:08:55,604
- I don't know how.

96
00:08:55,604 --> 00:08:57,329
- Me neither, son.

97
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:01,989
But we need to figure it out
or you're gonna lose them.

98
00:09:01,989 --> 00:09:02,990
- Yeah...

99
00:09:04,992 --> 00:09:06,235
I think I already
lost them, Dad.

100
00:09:21,077 --> 00:09:22,769
- They even left
the towels in the bathroom.

101
00:09:24,874 --> 00:09:27,221
all you have to do
is unpack a suitcase.

102
00:09:27,221 --> 00:09:28,913
- I'm 41 years old

103
00:09:28,913 --> 00:09:31,536
and this is the first thing
I ever owned.

104
00:09:31,536 --> 00:09:32,951
I own it.

105
00:09:32,951 --> 00:09:34,332
- Yes, you do.

106
00:09:35,402 --> 00:09:37,438
- I...

107
00:09:37,438 --> 00:09:39,579
I'm late.

108
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,890
- I'll see if I can figure out
that stove,

109
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,305
wrangle up some supper
when you get back.

110
00:09:45,412 --> 00:09:46,689
- Thank you.

111
00:09:46,689 --> 00:09:50,624
- Ah, cooking is one of the few
guiltless joys in life.

112
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:52,695
I don't mind.

113
00:09:52,695 --> 00:09:53,972
- That's not what
I was thanking you for.

114
00:09:57,217 --> 00:09:59,668
- You did all this on your own.

115
00:09:59,668 --> 00:10:01,117
- You gave me
the strength to do it.

116
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:05,432
- You always had
the strength, son.

117
00:10:05,432 --> 00:10:07,399
I just helped you to find it.

118
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:14,821
- See you this evening.

119
00:10:14,821 --> 00:10:16,063
- I'll be right here.

120
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:26,833
- You know, I used
to come here in my 20s.

121
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,421
It was a great place
to come drink

122
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:32,424
on some billionaire's bar tab
while he tried to fuck me.

123
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:36,290
One might say I lost my faith
in humanity in this very bar.

124
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,189
- Sounds like a few succeeded.

125
00:10:38,189 --> 00:10:40,536
- None succeeded,
though I did dry hump

126
00:10:40,536 --> 00:10:42,365
some lawyer's girlfriend
in the coat closet.

127
00:10:42,365 --> 00:10:43,884
That was interesting.

128
00:10:43,884 --> 00:10:47,785
- Hmm, I bet you carve them up
in the boardroom, don't you?

129
00:10:47,785 --> 00:10:50,615
- You wanted to meet.
I'm here. Why?

130
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:52,099
Hmm?

131
00:10:52,099 --> 00:10:54,895
Or maybe you just want to bump
uglies in the coat room, too.

132
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,347
He certainly does.

133
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:03,145
- Personally, I find
your behavior offensive

134
00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:04,940
and highly inappropriate.

135
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,597
- 'Til you jerk off to it
later, huh, sport?

136
00:11:07,597 --> 00:11:09,599
On second thought,
you might be wound

137
00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:11,601
a little tight for
self pleasure.

138
00:11:11,601 --> 00:11:14,052
I bet you pay top dollar for
somebody to drag you around

139
00:11:14,052 --> 00:11:15,985
on a dog leash, right?

140
00:11:15,985 --> 00:11:17,331
Slap you in the face
with a rubber dick.

141
00:11:18,747 --> 00:11:20,541
-
- Uh-oh.

142
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,440
Struck a nerve.

143
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,718
- I won't be spoken
to like this.

144
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:27,203
Caroline, I'll be in the lounge.
- Bye-bye.

145
00:11:30,586 --> 00:11:31,656
- Double Tito's three olives.

146
00:11:31,656 --> 00:11:34,245
- That's a mean memory,
my friend.

147
00:11:34,245 --> 00:11:39,112
Woo! Well, say hello to the new
boss, same as the old boss.

148
00:11:40,665 --> 00:11:44,704
- I'm very different
from the old boss, Beth.

149
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,051
I came up at a time
when the corporate ladder

150
00:11:47,051 --> 00:11:49,191
was greased
to keep women off it.

151
00:11:49,191 --> 00:11:50,882
I climbed it anyway,

152
00:11:50,882 --> 00:11:54,472
stepping over some little
bitch like you on every rung.

153
00:11:54,472 --> 00:11:57,371
The big dog is off
the porch now, Beth

154
00:11:57,371 --> 00:12:00,581
and I will tear you
to fucking pieces.

155
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:03,999
Starting with an
SEC investigation into you

156
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:07,209
for market manipulation
and insider trading.

157
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:08,797
You want to fight?

158
00:12:08,797 --> 00:12:12,662
Let me introduce you to the
fight of your fucking life.

159
00:12:12,662 --> 00:12:14,354
That's behind door number one.

160
00:12:14,354 --> 00:12:18,047
Behind door number two
is common ground.

161
00:12:20,705 --> 00:12:21,879
- Fire away.

162
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:26,435
- You put together a land trust
for Schwartz and Meyer--

163
00:12:26,435 --> 00:12:29,472
- I put together a land
trust for the Yellowstone.

164
00:12:29,472 --> 00:12:32,027
Schwartz and Meyer
is a minority investor

165
00:12:32,027 --> 00:12:33,787
with no controlling interest.

166
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:36,307
- Smart.
- I thought so.

167
00:12:36,307 --> 00:12:37,757
- We'd like to make
an offer on it.

168
00:12:40,863 --> 00:12:41,830
Not for sale.

169
00:12:43,521 --> 00:12:46,904
- That should be
your family's motto.

170
00:12:46,904 --> 00:12:50,355
Jamie leased us what
he could've sold

171
00:12:50,355 --> 00:12:53,462
and made the ranch 100 times
more than the lease fee.

172
00:12:53,462 --> 00:12:56,706
It'll be fifty years before
the ranch recoups that money.

173
00:12:56,706 --> 00:13:01,125
Stubbornness is not
a business strategy, Beth.

174
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,713
It's how you lose
the ranch altogether.

175
00:13:03,713 --> 00:13:05,370
You're smart enough
to know that.

176
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,579
- Oh, I know it.

177
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:10,272
And if we still own it
by the time my father dies,

178
00:13:10,272 --> 00:13:12,308
you're my first call.

179
00:13:12,308 --> 00:13:15,173
But in the meantime,
his dream is my Alamo,

180
00:13:15,173 --> 00:13:18,590
and I will die on
the fucking wall defending it.

181
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,628
- Come and work for us
and I'll help you defend it.

182
00:13:25,735 --> 00:13:27,047
- Doing what?

183
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:30,464
you're a corporate raider.

184
00:13:30,464 --> 00:13:32,673
Come and raid
for Market Equities.

185
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,851
- You apply logic to your
decisions with no emotion.

186
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:39,957
I respect that.

187
00:13:39,957 --> 00:13:43,512
But asking a wolf to protect
the sheep, that is a mistake.

188
00:13:43,512 --> 00:13:45,997
And you're smart enough
to know that.

189
00:13:45,997 --> 00:13:48,448
- You can have the sheep, Beth.

190
00:13:48,448 --> 00:13:51,727
I've taken all your father's
ranch I need for the moment.

191
00:13:51,727 --> 00:13:54,109
You want to save the rest of it?

192
00:13:54,109 --> 00:13:55,696
Find me something better.

193
00:13:57,181 --> 00:13:59,217
- What are you building now?

194
00:13:59,217 --> 00:14:02,048
- Every resource of Montana

195
00:14:02,048 --> 00:14:04,464
can be grown
somewhere else for less.

196
00:14:04,464 --> 00:14:10,366
The fantasy of the West is
its only resource of any value.

197
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:13,611
Colorado embraced
that decades ago.

198
00:14:13,611 --> 00:14:16,096
It's time Montana
did the same.

199
00:14:16,096 --> 00:14:19,997
Build me Aspen,
build me Breckenridge.

200
00:14:19,997 --> 00:14:24,553
I want a destination town
in every valley.

201
00:14:24,553 --> 00:14:28,005
But I need an
insider to do that.

202
00:14:28,005 --> 00:14:30,490
This is a name-your-price
offer, Beth.

203
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,667
- You have a
controlling interest

204
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:39,016
of Schwartz and Meyer
now, right?

205
00:14:39,016 --> 00:14:41,018
That's my price.

206
00:14:41,018 --> 00:14:42,951
- You want a piece
of Schwartz and Meyer?

207
00:14:42,951 --> 00:14:44,331
- I want your piece.

208
00:14:45,746 --> 00:14:47,162
You give me that, I'm yours.

209
00:14:47,162 --> 00:14:48,888
- You're going to fire him.

210
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,924
- I'm going
to bankrupt him first.

211
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:53,133
I want his fucking
grandchildren on welfare.

212
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:54,894
You break your word to me,

213
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:57,689
lady, I'll do the same to you.

214
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,147
You have my number.

215
00:15:11,531 --> 00:15:13,809
- What do you think?

216
00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:16,536
- Oh, I think she's
a walking lawsuit.

217
00:15:16,536 --> 00:15:18,607
- I think she can make Montana

218
00:15:18,607 --> 00:15:20,747
the fastest growing state
in the nation.

219
00:15:22,162 --> 00:15:25,925
Behind every milestone of human
history stands a monster.

220
00:15:27,478 --> 00:15:29,929
And that's our monster.

221
00:15:43,183 --> 00:15:46,014
- You are bullying this through
and we will not have it.
Hm.

222
00:15:46,014 --> 00:15:48,050
- We will file suit
to halt construction

223
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,984
until an environmental
impact study has been filed.

224
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:53,021
- The Department of the Interior
is conducting the E.I.S.

225
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:54,056
at the ski resort.

226
00:15:54,056 --> 00:15:55,920
- I'm talking about the airport.

227
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,646
- Well, that build's
on private land.

228
00:15:57,646 --> 00:15:59,510
- It's a lease-back
to the State.

229
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,995
- When construction is complete.

230
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,652
- It's a bullshit loophole,
Jamie.

231
00:16:03,652 --> 00:16:07,794
the lawsuit
will name the State as well.

232
00:16:07,794 --> 00:16:09,658
- Oh.

233
00:16:09,658 --> 00:16:12,281
Well, the Market Equities
group has no obligation

234
00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:13,558
to publish a study.

235
00:16:13,558 --> 00:16:16,216
The government has
no authority to mandate it.

236
00:16:16,216 --> 00:16:19,047
State and Federal building codes
are being followed.

237
00:16:19,047 --> 00:16:22,947
But if your law firm would like
to dispute that, file suit.

238
00:16:22,947 --> 00:16:25,260
I will see you in court
where it will be

239
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,433
dismissed with prejudice,

240
00:16:26,433 --> 00:16:28,504
at which point the state
will file countersuit

241
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:30,299
for abuse of process.

242
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:34,234
Now, the state of Montana
is the beneficiary

243
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:37,134
of a privately funded
6 billion dollar

244
00:16:37,134 --> 00:16:39,343
infrastructure investment
that will yield

245
00:16:39,343 --> 00:16:42,691
thousands of jobs
and billions in revenue.

246
00:16:42,691 --> 00:16:45,245
We will stand firm
with the M.E. group

247
00:16:45,245 --> 00:16:47,351
and their investment
in our state

248
00:16:47,351 --> 00:16:50,112
and I will vigorously
defend their right to do it.

249
00:16:50,112 --> 00:16:52,666
Now, if any of you want
to challenge that,

250
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,290
bring your best
and I'll bring mine.

251
00:16:59,846 --> 00:17:02,297
This a land grab, Jamie.
And you know it.

252
00:17:02,297 --> 00:17:04,747
- No one's being forced
to sell their land, Ruth.

253
00:17:04,747 --> 00:17:06,611
These are private
transactions on land

254
00:17:06,611 --> 00:17:08,096
in which your client
has no sway.

255
00:17:08,096 --> 00:17:09,821
Not that your client cares
about the little things

256
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,892
like legal precedent
and case law.

257
00:17:11,892 --> 00:17:14,274
- My client cares about Montana.

258
00:17:14,274 --> 00:17:16,380
About the rivers
this will pollute

259
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,520
and the animals
this will displace.

260
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,972
- 6,000 jobs.

261
00:17:22,972 --> 00:17:25,320
My recommendation is you take
this in front of a judge

262
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,046
who does not want
to be re-elected.

263
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,357
- Look...

264
00:17:28,357 --> 00:17:30,325
We're here to negotiate.

265
00:17:30,325 --> 00:17:33,466
- We have no interest
in negotiating.

266
00:17:33,466 --> 00:17:36,262
- So, the State's position
is essentially 'fuck off.'

267
00:17:38,574 --> 00:17:39,575
- Yeah.

268
00:17:50,724 --> 00:17:53,934
Would Defenders file
in District 6 or 22?

269
00:17:57,455 --> 00:17:58,767
Hold my calls.

270
00:18:15,784 --> 00:18:17,130
How are you, Kayce?

271
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:20,133
- I've been better.

272
00:18:22,066 --> 00:18:23,067
You?

273
00:18:25,725 --> 00:18:28,866
- Just hiding in my work,
if you know what I mean.

274
00:18:29,867 --> 00:18:31,040
- Yeah, I do.

275
00:18:33,629 --> 00:18:34,699
- It's good to see you.

276
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,602
- You didn't come around.

277
00:18:41,948 --> 00:18:44,364
You didn't call, nothing.
You just...

278
00:18:44,364 --> 00:18:45,814
Disappeared.

279
00:18:45,814 --> 00:18:50,612
- I have yet to stop
fighting for this family.

280
00:18:50,612 --> 00:18:53,132
I was the reason
there was police protection

281
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,203
for him at that hospital
for two months.

282
00:18:57,688 --> 00:19:00,898
I was the reason that
there was no investigation

283
00:19:00,898 --> 00:19:03,314
into the murders at the ranch--

284
00:19:03,314 --> 00:19:04,695
- That was self defense.

285
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:09,734
- One assailant
executed in the kitchen,

286
00:19:09,734 --> 00:19:11,771
one shot in the back
near the barn,

287
00:19:11,771 --> 00:19:14,877
another hung from
the corral gate.

288
00:19:14,877 --> 00:19:19,365
And you, without any
authority whatsoever to do so,

289
00:19:19,365 --> 00:19:22,402
ram a vehicle,
kill everyone inside

290
00:19:22,402 --> 00:19:23,679
with an assault rifle
in the middle

291
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,371
of a fucking intersection.

292
00:19:25,371 --> 00:19:27,442
- Those were the men
that attacked our father.

293
00:19:27,442 --> 00:19:28,822
- It doesn't matter.

294
00:19:28,822 --> 00:19:32,412
There's is what's just
and there's the law.

295
00:19:33,931 --> 00:19:36,209
They are not the same thing.

296
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:38,867
And I am the reason
no one is sitting in prison,

297
00:19:38,867 --> 00:19:41,697
learning that hard lesson
right now.

298
00:19:41,697 --> 00:19:43,112
- You didn't visit him.

299
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,703
You didn't call him.
Not one of us.

300
00:19:47,703 --> 00:19:50,706
- I couldn't visit.
I couldn't call.

301
00:19:50,706 --> 00:19:52,294
That would labeled collusion

302
00:19:52,294 --> 00:19:53,778
and everything I swept
under the rug would be

303
00:19:53,778 --> 00:19:56,125
out in the fucking floor
for the whole world to see.

304
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,748
Besides, Beth
is always by his side.

305
00:19:57,748 --> 00:20:00,475
and the only space
I will share with that bitch

306
00:20:00,475 --> 00:20:02,270
is a court room
or her fucking death bed.

307
00:20:06,066 --> 00:20:07,482
He hates me because of her.

308
00:20:09,484 --> 00:20:10,864
- He doesn't hate you, Jamie.

309
00:20:13,453 --> 00:20:14,730
He's why I'm here.

310
00:20:21,323 --> 00:20:23,118
This is the man who
took a hit out on us.

311
00:20:41,136 --> 00:20:44,829
- This man has been
in prison for twenty years.

312
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:45,968
What makes you think it's him?

313
00:20:47,142 --> 00:20:50,249
- Dad says it's
from a reliable source.

314
00:20:52,872 --> 00:20:54,460
- Care to share the source?

315
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,496
- He didn't say.

316
00:20:56,496 --> 00:20:57,842
- Figures.

317
00:21:01,915 --> 00:21:03,262
What does he want from me?

318
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:06,851
- Just take a look
at his prison file,

319
00:21:06,851 --> 00:21:09,060
see if you can make
a connection.

320
00:21:10,821 --> 00:21:12,271
Maybe let me interview him,
or...

321
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,720
- Hmm.

322
00:21:14,514 --> 00:21:16,067
Mm-mm.

323
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:17,655
This must be by the book, Kayce.

324
00:21:17,655 --> 00:21:19,830
These guys know
the law as well as I do.

325
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,280
His attorney will be present.

326
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,867
The interview will
be recorded.

327
00:21:22,867 --> 00:21:27,113
It's got to be a detective from
homicide and a State's Attorney.

328
00:21:27,113 --> 00:21:28,632
- He doesn't want
some State's Attorney.

329
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:32,739
He wants you, Jamie.

330
00:21:42,508 --> 00:21:43,888
- He wants me to do it?

331
00:21:43,888 --> 00:21:45,925
- Yeah.

332
00:21:45,925 --> 00:21:47,789
Only people you
can trust is family.

333
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,623
Will you do it?

334
00:22:01,561 --> 00:22:02,769
- Of course I'll do it.

335
00:22:09,845 --> 00:22:11,088
- Thank you.

336
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:23,203
I love you, brother.

337
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:27,760
- I love you.

338
00:22:45,225 --> 00:22:47,918
- Hey, hey!
- Buck, buck, buck!

339
00:22:47,918 --> 00:22:50,472
- Hup, hup!

340
00:22:50,472 --> 00:22:52,509
Hey! This 'un too.

341
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:55,650
- Hell, the whole damn
herd has pink eye.

342
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:58,169
Let's push 'em into the arena,
we'll run 'em through the chute.

343
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:00,344
- You don't want these sick
sum'bitches in the arena.

344
00:23:00,344 --> 00:23:02,484
Why don't we just
doctor 'em right here?

345
00:23:02,484 --> 00:23:05,625
- Well, I fucking said so.

346
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:07,903
- I didn't know you was boss
when boss is gone.

347
00:23:07,903 --> 00:23:10,596
- Hey, I'm always the boss
when the boss is gone.

348
00:23:10,596 --> 00:23:12,908
- Look, he's right,
we should doctor 'em right here.

349
00:23:12,908 --> 00:23:14,979
- Push them in
the fucking arena!

350
00:23:14,979 --> 00:23:17,016
We start dragging 'em
in the pasture

351
00:23:17,016 --> 00:23:18,604
they'll scatter
to hell and gone.

352
00:23:25,852 --> 00:23:27,371
- You saddle those horses?

353
00:23:27,371 --> 00:23:28,510
- They're tied outside.

354
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,098
- You and I are talking later.

355
00:23:31,237 --> 00:23:32,963
- Am I in trouble?

356
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:35,310
- Is he in trouble?

357
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,863
- He pissed your
daughter off pretty good.

358
00:23:41,834 --> 00:23:43,145
- Then he's in trouble.

359
00:23:51,878 --> 00:23:53,742
Thought we were doctoring today.

360
00:23:53,742 --> 00:23:55,261
- So did I.

361
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,063
Lloyd! Get over here.

362
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,206
What in the fuck
are you doing?

363
00:24:09,206 --> 00:24:10,828
- Running them
through the chute.

364
00:24:10,828 --> 00:24:13,141
- Well, a couple of those got
pink eye, I can see it
from here.

365
00:24:13,141 --> 00:24:15,695
- They all do. We got to doctor
the whole damn herd.

366
00:24:15,695 --> 00:24:17,145
- Well, don't
bring them in here.

367
00:24:17,145 --> 00:24:18,940
You'll give every animal
we got fucking pink eye.

368
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,252
- It's faster and easier
in the chute.

369
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:23,807
- Doctoring cattle ain't
a fucking timed event, Lloyd.

370
00:24:23,807 --> 00:24:26,326
And easy doesn't
factor in at all.

371
00:24:28,881 --> 00:24:30,296
- Lloyd, you listen to me.

372
00:24:30,296 --> 00:24:33,126
You move those fucking heifers
out, do your fucking job.

373
00:24:33,126 --> 00:24:34,611
Go!

374
00:24:34,611 --> 00:24:35,853
- Push 'em back out.

375
00:24:35,853 --> 00:24:38,131
- Let's go, move 'em out!
Push them back!

376
00:24:39,685 --> 00:24:43,274
- Push 'em back out.
That means you too, Walker.

377
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:46,105
- Hell, you're the boss.
Hear that, boys?

378
00:24:46,105 --> 00:24:47,865
The boss is going to let us
play cowboy today.

379
00:24:47,865 --> 00:24:49,004
How about that shit?

380
00:24:57,392 --> 00:24:58,980
- Ho! Ho, ho!

381
00:25:18,793 --> 00:25:20,001
- Let 'em go!

382
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:37,536
- Lloyd.

383
00:25:43,783 --> 00:25:47,131
Not like you to take short cuts.
What's the matter with you?

384
00:25:47,131 --> 00:25:50,963
- Didn't mean it to be a
short cut, it just seems...

385
00:25:50,963 --> 00:25:53,275
Them girls,
they can't rope and--

386
00:25:53,275 --> 00:25:55,346
- Not looking for an answer.

387
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:11,362
How was he?

388
00:26:12,432 --> 00:26:13,744
- I asked for the file,

389
00:26:13,744 --> 00:26:16,954
I asked for the interview
and he didn't blink.

390
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:19,785
Just said yes.

391
00:26:19,785 --> 00:26:21,994
He's gonna notify
the inmate's attorney,

392
00:26:21,994 --> 00:26:24,237
and that homicide detective
at the Sheriff's office.

393
00:26:24,237 --> 00:26:25,480
Just the way
you're supposed to do it.

394
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,448
- Good.
Good.

395
00:26:29,449 --> 00:26:30,796
- I, uh, thought about our talk.

396
00:26:33,143 --> 00:26:34,489
- Come up with an idea?

397
00:26:34,489 --> 00:26:36,077
- I think so.

398
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,494
It's not gonna be easy
on either of us.

399
00:26:39,494 --> 00:26:40,633
But it feels right.

400
00:26:44,188 --> 00:26:45,189
Then it probably is, son.

401
00:27:05,037 --> 00:27:06,555
- He's getting a little old
for that, ain't he?

402
00:27:14,563 --> 00:27:17,463
It's the only way he'll
let me do it.

403
00:27:17,463 --> 00:27:20,742
Some day soon
he won't let me do it at all,

404
00:27:20,742 --> 00:27:22,537
and another thing
we've shared is gone.

405
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,023
- Can I talk to you
for a second?

406
00:27:42,384 --> 00:27:43,385
Did you mean it?

407
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:45,698
- Mean what?

408
00:27:47,182 --> 00:27:49,426
- Do you hate me?

409
00:27:49,426 --> 00:27:51,773
- Kayce, I don't have the
strength to do this right now.

410
00:27:51,773 --> 00:27:52,809
- Find it.

411
00:27:54,569 --> 00:27:56,260
- If I hated you,
I would've left.

412
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:08,307
- He's never gonna get better
staying here.

413
00:28:11,241 --> 00:28:12,760
And neither will you.

414
00:28:14,934 --> 00:28:18,317
I was thinking
we could go

415
00:28:18,317 --> 00:28:19,387
stay at your grandfather's
place for a while

416
00:28:19,387 --> 00:28:21,113
until we find another
place close--

417
00:28:26,256 --> 00:28:28,499
When?

418
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:29,500
- How fast can you pack?

419
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,407
- Where are we going?

420
00:28:40,684 --> 00:28:41,961
- Grandpa Felix.

421
00:28:48,796 --> 00:28:51,108
- You coming, too?

422
00:28:51,108 --> 00:28:53,801
- Oh, yeah.
We're all going, son.

423
00:29:16,582 --> 00:29:18,170
I'll be back in a couple days.

424
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,383
- The Rez?

425
00:29:24,383 --> 00:29:26,765
- Yeah, somewhere near it.

426
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,283
Close to her family
and friends.

427
00:29:30,423 --> 00:29:32,805
She could use a dose of that.

428
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:33,772
They both could.

429
00:29:35,704 --> 00:29:38,397
- Yeah, no doubt.

430
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:42,263
- It ain't permanent,
I'll just be

431
00:29:42,263 --> 00:29:43,505
back and forth for a while.

432
00:29:46,232 --> 00:29:47,233
- Yep.

433
00:30:13,535 --> 00:30:16,124
- I'm up two.
- I'm up five games.

434
00:30:16,124 --> 00:30:18,575
Five games, so that's...
- All palaces are temporary.

435
00:30:18,575 --> 00:30:22,579
<i>♪ When I was in school some
bullies were picking on me ♪</i>

436
00:30:22,579 --> 00:30:23,822
<i>♪ Pushed me down
at the playground... ♪</i>

437
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,271
- Would you stop eating
that fucking garbage?

438
00:30:25,271 --> 00:30:26,410
Dinner's almost ready.

439
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,584
- You're wasting your time,
Teeter,

440
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,827
no one is gonna eat
a thing that you cook.

441
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,242
- When does Gator get back?

442
00:30:30,242 --> 00:30:31,450
- Thursday.

443
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:33,797
- Thursday?
I'm gonna be dead by then.

444
00:30:33,797 --> 00:30:35,488
I can already
feel my organs shutting down.

445
00:30:35,488 --> 00:30:37,905
Walker, you know
any hunger songs?

446
00:30:37,905 --> 00:30:39,147
- No.

447
00:30:44,187 --> 00:30:47,915
- Oh, um... No, I'm good.

448
00:30:47,915 --> 00:30:49,261
- Come on, baby,
I keep cooking,

449
00:30:49,261 --> 00:30:50,469
you keep not eating.

450
00:30:50,469 --> 00:30:52,057
I need you strong for later.

451
00:30:52,057 --> 00:30:54,266
- Fuck it, I'm so hungry I'll
eat anything right now.

452
00:30:54,266 --> 00:30:56,716
- Oh, I wouldn't,
it's probably gonna be...

453
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:00,410
- Come on.
- Don't fucking lie.

454
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:01,721
- Good or bad?

455
00:31:01,721 --> 00:31:03,102
- It's fucking great.
- It's fucking great.

456
00:31:03,102 --> 00:31:04,690
- It is?
- Yeah.

457
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,036
Uh, uh, uh,
wait your turn.

458
00:31:06,036 --> 00:31:08,038
I slaved over this fucking meal.

459
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:09,833
- What's in it?
- Everything, baby.

460
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:11,248
- I think there's a vegetable,
I could be...

461
00:31:11,248 --> 00:31:12,767
- Like a vegetable bisque?

462
00:31:12,767 --> 00:31:15,287
- Kinda like little sausages?
Just everything, baby.

463
00:31:15,287 --> 00:31:16,460
- Tomato.

464
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,429
- This baby doll is my favorite.
My favorite.

465
00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:21,983
- And, um... I don't know
if that's chicken.

466
00:31:21,983 --> 00:31:23,433
- I'm hungry.
- You ever heard of manners?

467
00:31:23,433 --> 00:31:24,848
- I'm the short, fat guy.

468
00:31:24,848 --> 00:31:26,125
- I don't know, it's just
kind of different.

469
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:27,575
What does that mean,
like, what's in it?

470
00:31:27,575 --> 00:31:28,956
- Not really sure, but never
tasted anything quite like it.

471
00:31:28,956 --> 00:31:29,957
What do you call it?

472
00:31:29,957 --> 00:31:31,130
- Sum bits.

473
00:31:32,338 --> 00:31:33,615
- For fuck's sakes.

474
00:31:33,615 --> 00:31:34,720
What does that mean?

475
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,377
- It means it's good
for you, honey.

476
00:31:37,516 --> 00:31:39,035
- What does that mean?

477
00:31:39,035 --> 00:31:41,658
- Literally everything from
the cow that nobody else wants.

478
00:31:41,658 --> 00:31:43,763
- It's the whole cow.

479
00:31:43,763 --> 00:31:45,144
- You mean everything
in the cow?

480
00:31:45,144 --> 00:31:46,318
- Evidently.

481
00:31:46,318 --> 00:31:47,319
- Ew, I got a eyeball.

482
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:48,492
- That's disgusting.

483
00:31:48,492 --> 00:31:49,493
- Still good.

484
00:31:49,493 --> 00:31:50,563
- Tastes good to me.

485
00:31:50,563 --> 00:31:51,875
- Come on.

486
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:53,049
- You're just full of surprises,
aren't you?

487
00:31:53,049 --> 00:31:56,328
- I told you, my organs
were shutting down.

488
00:31:56,328 --> 00:31:58,123
That shit will surely kill me.

489
00:31:58,123 --> 00:31:59,918
- Hey, you hungry?

490
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,506
- It's rodeo season, Laramie.

491
00:32:02,506 --> 00:32:03,542
We should be on the road.

492
00:32:05,026 --> 00:32:07,304
- Oh.
That's not what I asked.

493
00:32:07,304 --> 00:32:08,719
- I'm pulling out tomorrow.

494
00:32:17,176 --> 00:32:19,282
You know, you're eating
intestines you should be
ashamed of yourself.

495
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:27,842
- You ain't eating?

496
00:32:27,842 --> 00:32:31,087
Oh, no, bro.
He's intermittent fasting.

497
00:32:31,087 --> 00:32:32,847
- Getting ready for
swimsuit season.

498
00:32:32,847 --> 00:32:35,125
- Yeah, cold water doesn't
bother him too much.

499
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:36,644
So he's just...

500
00:32:36,644 --> 00:32:38,749
Sorry, you didn't think that was
funny? I thought it was funny.

501
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:40,441
I'm hungry. Very hungry.

502
00:32:42,374 --> 00:32:44,031
- You want to fucking
dance, old man?

503
00:32:45,342 --> 00:32:47,034
- Whoa.
- Hey! Stop it!

504
00:32:47,034 --> 00:32:49,415
- Shit!
- Stop it!

505
00:32:49,415 --> 00:32:51,141
- You ain't fucking
singing now, are you?

506
00:32:55,939 --> 00:32:58,390
- Stop it!
Stop it!

507
00:33:01,634 --> 00:33:05,431
- What a fucking mess you've
made of your last second chance.

508
00:33:07,192 --> 00:33:10,574
Life is a lesson, boy.
One long lesson.

509
00:33:10,574 --> 00:33:12,680
But you gotta look
to learn them,

510
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,199
and you ain't fucking looking.

511
00:33:25,106 --> 00:33:26,176
- Stop it!
Stop it!

512
00:33:29,179 --> 00:33:30,663
Motherfucker!

513
00:33:30,663 --> 00:33:32,010
You motherfucker!

514
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:45,402
- What's the rule
about fighting, Lloyd?

515
00:33:45,402 --> 00:33:46,645
Hmm?

516
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:56,862
Goddam you for
making me do this.

517
00:34:16,606 --> 00:34:18,539
There's no fighting
on this ranch.

518
00:34:18,539 --> 00:34:20,472
You want to fight somebody,
you come fight me.

519
00:34:20,472 --> 00:34:22,025
I'll fight you all fucking day.

520
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:33,381
Son of a bitch.

521
00:35:39,206 --> 00:35:40,621
- I stand corrected.

522
00:35:41,829 --> 00:35:44,072
- Horses I know, honey.

523
00:35:44,072 --> 00:35:45,798
We gotta find a way to
make a business of this place

524
00:35:45,798 --> 00:35:47,593
beyond cattle.

525
00:35:47,593 --> 00:35:49,388
- You'll get
no argument from me.

526
00:35:49,388 --> 00:35:51,149
- Good, 'cause you're
running that end of it.

527
00:35:53,116 --> 00:35:55,049
- I got a job offer today.

528
00:35:56,464 --> 00:35:58,639
Market Equities, they want me
to oversee

529
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:00,675
all development
projects in Montana.

530
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:04,127
- What did you tell them?

531
00:36:04,127 --> 00:36:06,233
- I made them an offer
they can't accept.

532
00:36:07,613 --> 00:36:08,718
- What if they do?

533
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,311
- Well, you went into politics

534
00:36:15,311 --> 00:36:17,451
to control the things
a ranch can't control.

535
00:36:19,763 --> 00:36:21,420
Kayce, Jamie the same.

536
00:36:22,904 --> 00:36:27,012
You shit the bed with Jamie,
but control was your intent.

537
00:36:27,012 --> 00:36:28,910
It might have the same effect,

538
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:33,501
me working for the company
that you're fighting against.

539
00:36:39,887 --> 00:36:43,131
And my loyalty is
the one thing on this planet

540
00:36:43,131 --> 00:36:45,306
that you don't have
to worry about.

541
00:36:49,034 --> 00:36:51,416
- Do what you think
is best, sweetheart.

542
00:36:51,416 --> 00:36:54,108
- I'll still make a business out
of this place for you, Daddy.

543
00:36:54,108 --> 00:36:55,592
Just don't come bitching
to me when

544
00:36:55,592 --> 00:36:58,181
there's 300 people in that
arena for a fucking wedding.

545
00:36:58,181 --> 00:37:00,839
- No weddings. No.

546
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:04,394
- Big ones and lots of them.

547
00:37:06,154 --> 00:37:07,155
Good night, Dad.

548
00:37:09,399 --> 00:37:10,573
- Kayce left today.

549
00:37:13,265 --> 00:37:14,577
- Left?

550
00:37:14,577 --> 00:37:17,476
- To Monica's folks.

551
00:37:17,476 --> 00:37:18,995
Needed a break from this place.

552
00:37:20,893 --> 00:37:22,378
- Well, that's understandable.

553
00:37:24,483 --> 00:37:28,349
- Why do all of my children
have to leave to find happiness?

554
00:37:29,488 --> 00:37:32,180
- It's a unique situation.

555
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,734
- The reason is unique,
I'll give you that.

556
00:37:35,494 --> 00:37:38,739
But the situation
is exactly the same.

557
00:37:38,739 --> 00:37:40,775
- It's because there's
no peace in this place, Dad.

558
00:37:43,744 --> 00:37:46,194
Never has been.

559
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:49,577
It doesn't bother you or Kayce
because you aren't peaceful men.

560
00:37:54,824 --> 00:37:56,550
Guess I'm not peaceful either.

561
00:38:00,139 --> 00:38:01,934
You know what you need?

562
00:38:01,934 --> 00:38:03,004
- What's that, honey?

563
00:38:04,592 --> 00:38:06,801
- You need some pussy.

564
00:38:06,801 --> 00:38:08,355
I'm gonna get you a girlfriend.

565
00:38:08,355 --> 00:38:10,149
- Beth, that's too far, okay?
- No, it's what you need.

566
00:38:10,149 --> 00:38:12,290
- This whole man-to-man shit
thing we got going is just--

567
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,567
- I'm on it.
- Beth.

568
00:38:13,567 --> 00:38:15,154
- I got it.
- Beth.

569
00:38:15,154 --> 00:38:16,294
- I'm on it.

570
00:38:33,138 --> 00:38:34,760
- You have no future...

571
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,279
None...

572
00:38:36,279 --> 00:38:38,177
Beyond this place.

573
00:38:38,177 --> 00:38:41,733
And if you don't find a way
to get her trust back,

574
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:44,080
you're not gonna
have this either.

575
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,325
And then your life
is, well,it's like your
father's life.

576
00:38:49,257 --> 00:38:50,466
And you know how that ended.

577
00:38:52,468 --> 00:38:54,332
There's two roads in life.

578
00:38:55,643 --> 00:38:58,612
One is you're winning
or learning.

579
00:38:58,612 --> 00:39:01,477
And the other is
that you're losing all the way

580
00:39:01,477 --> 00:39:03,099
to the fucking grave.

581
00:39:05,757 --> 00:39:08,449
Boy, you'd better choose quickly

582
00:39:08,449 --> 00:39:10,106
or life's gonna
choose it for you.

583
00:39:34,855 --> 00:39:35,821
You want me to drive?

584
00:39:35,821 --> 00:39:37,236
- I drive.

585
00:39:38,755 --> 00:39:40,308
- You're the only one
who hasn't slept.

586
00:39:41,586 --> 00:39:44,485
- 125,000 dollar truck
pulling a million dollars

587
00:39:44,485 --> 00:39:46,694
worth of horses
in a 150,000 dollar trailer.

588
00:39:46,694 --> 00:39:47,902
I drive.

589
00:39:51,009 --> 00:39:53,183
- Just thought
you might be tired.

590
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:56,394
- Buddy, I'll get all the sleep
I need when I'm dead.

591
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,292
Remember that movie?

592
00:39:58,292 --> 00:39:59,638
- What movie?

593
00:39:59,638 --> 00:40:02,986
Road House.

594
00:40:02,986 --> 00:40:06,818
- What, you're saying that Road
House is the best movie ever--

595
00:40:06,818 --> 00:40:08,751
- Ever fucking made.
Ever.

596
00:40:08,751 --> 00:40:11,409
Goddamn, when I grow up
I want to be Sam Elliott.

597
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,618
With Patrick Swayze's hair.

598
00:40:13,618 --> 00:40:15,482
Man, I wish the mullet would
come back in style, don't you?

599
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:19,934
Well, I guess you don't.

600
00:40:19,934 --> 00:40:22,109
Speaking of hair,
next truck stop we find,

601
00:40:22,109 --> 00:40:23,110
you need to shave
all this shit off.

602
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:24,352
You look fucking homeless.

603
00:40:24,352 --> 00:40:27,597
They will not stand
for that in West Texas.

604
00:40:27,597 --> 00:40:29,565
- Girlfriend likes it.
- Girlfriend's a fucking idiot.

605
00:40:33,189 --> 00:40:35,536
So, you like to rodeo, huh?

606
00:40:35,536 --> 00:40:38,505
- Its kind of the only thing
I was ever any good at.

607
00:40:38,505 --> 00:40:40,196
- What, you're fucking
good at rodeo?

608
00:40:40,196 --> 00:40:44,580
Fucking neck broke, back broke,
everything all fucked up.

609
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,546
So, why do you do it?

610
00:40:47,514 --> 00:40:50,551
- I don't know,
I liked the...

611
00:40:50,551 --> 00:40:51,932
I like the lights.
I like the crowd.

612
00:40:51,932 --> 00:40:54,279
I liked that...
they fucking liked me.

613
00:40:55,418 --> 00:40:58,145
- What about the horses?
You like them?

614
00:40:58,145 --> 00:41:00,665
- It's kind of more
like facing a fear.

615
00:41:02,045 --> 00:41:03,322
I'm too fucking scared of 'em
to like them.

616
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:06,602
- Let me tell you something,
Jimmy, to be any good

617
00:41:06,602 --> 00:41:09,467
at this game, all right?

618
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:13,091
Ranching, rodeo, show horses,

619
00:41:13,091 --> 00:41:17,198
You got to do it for the horse.
Right?

620
00:41:17,198 --> 00:41:18,614
And where you're going...

621
00:41:18,614 --> 00:41:20,305
a horse is gonna
be your only fucking friend

622
00:41:20,305 --> 00:41:22,169
and you two are gonna have
to figure it the fuck out.

623
00:41:22,169 --> 00:41:24,378
And that's all cowboying is,
all right?

624
00:41:24,378 --> 00:41:26,587
It's you and a horse
doing a job,

625
00:41:26,587 --> 00:41:28,278
trying like hell to not
let the other down.

626
00:41:29,866 --> 00:41:31,696
I'll say this.

627
00:41:31,696 --> 00:41:33,594
When the Sixes is done with you,

628
00:41:33,594 --> 00:41:35,458
you will either spend
the rest of your life horseback

629
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:37,218
or you will never
get on another one.

630
00:41:40,705 --> 00:41:42,085
Get some rest, Jimmy.

631
00:41:43,777 --> 00:41:45,192
You are gonna fucking need it.

632
00:42:08,836 --> 00:42:10,148
- Morning.

633
00:42:11,183 --> 00:42:13,910
-
Not yet it ain't.

634
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:17,431
- We've established this pattern

635
00:42:17,431 --> 00:42:19,675
where you wake up
at dawn to go to work,

636
00:42:19,675 --> 00:42:22,988
and then I wake up
and want to fuck

637
00:42:22,988 --> 00:42:25,750
and then I have to convince
you that the day can wait,
well...

638
00:42:27,959 --> 00:42:29,236
The day hasn't started yet,

639
00:42:29,236 --> 00:42:31,721
so you're out of
fucking excuses, buddy.

640
00:42:35,173 --> 00:42:36,519
- Get to work.

641
00:42:43,181 --> 00:42:44,976
- You are the perfect woman,
you know that?

642
00:42:44,976 --> 00:42:46,529
- I am aware.

643
00:42:47,841 --> 00:42:49,946
When's your birthday?

644
00:42:49,946 --> 00:42:51,085
- Hmm?

645
00:42:53,605 --> 00:42:55,055
- Your birthday.

646
00:42:56,677 --> 00:42:59,024
- Sweetie, let's talk about
this in fifteen minutes--

647
00:42:59,024 --> 00:43:00,163
- When is it?

648
00:43:02,165 --> 00:43:04,340
When is it?

649
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,204
- I don't know, Beth.

650
00:43:06,204 --> 00:43:07,308
- What do you mean,
you don't know?

651
00:43:07,308 --> 00:43:08,896
Look on your driver's license.

652
00:43:09,932 --> 00:43:13,452
- I don't have one.

653
00:43:13,452 --> 00:43:15,213
When I said to you
that there's no proof

654
00:43:15,213 --> 00:43:16,697
of my existence, I meant it.

655
00:43:22,461 --> 00:43:24,325
- Did you know it
when you were a boy?

656
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:28,606
- Being brought into
this world wasn't something

657
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,297
that my family celebrated.

658
00:43:35,785 --> 00:43:36,890
Hey.

659
00:43:39,547 --> 00:43:41,895
I don't want to make
you upset.

660
00:43:41,895 --> 00:43:43,482
Hell, you don't even
celebrate your birthday.

661
00:43:43,482 --> 00:43:46,796
- I choose fucking not to.
I know when it is.

662
00:43:46,796 --> 00:43:48,660
- I don't know what to say.
I mean, it is what it is.

663
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,075
- Then we pick it.

664
00:43:50,075 --> 00:43:51,663
- Pick what, Beth?

665
00:43:51,663 --> 00:43:53,596
- We're gonna pick
your fucking birthday.

666
00:43:53,596 --> 00:43:55,115
September 28th.

667
00:43:55,115 --> 00:43:56,357
- I don't want to celebrate--

668
00:43:56,357 --> 00:44:00,327
- Your birthday's is on
the 28th of September.

669
00:44:00,327 --> 00:44:03,226
Okay?
-
Okay.

670
00:44:03,226 --> 00:44:04,607
- And we're gonna celebrate you.

671
00:44:07,506 --> 00:44:09,647
We're celebrating you, baby.

672
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:26,698
- Doc?

673
00:44:26,698 --> 00:44:28,389
Yes, sir, yeah.

674
00:44:28,389 --> 00:44:29,770
Yeah, we're here.

675
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:31,151
Where do you want him?

676
00:44:31,151 --> 00:44:34,706
All right I'll have him there
in about twenty minutes.

677
00:44:34,706 --> 00:44:36,294
Yes, sir. Bye.

678
00:44:39,366 --> 00:44:41,679
- This is it?
- This is it.

679
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,373
- How far does it go?

680
00:44:46,373 --> 00:44:49,203
- To the horizon
in every direction.

681
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:40,358
Oh fuck.

682
00:45:54,372 --> 00:45:56,684
Yeah, I've got it.

683
00:45:56,684 --> 00:45:58,031
All right, I have to go.

684
00:46:00,033 --> 00:46:02,760
This came over from
the Bureau of Prisons.

685
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,486
- Mm.

686
00:46:05,486 --> 00:46:06,902
Thank you.

687
00:46:17,809 --> 00:46:19,431
Mm.

688
00:46:38,623 --> 00:46:39,831
Oh, my God.

689
00:47:20,596 --> 00:47:21,839
- See you around, Jimmy.

690
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,426
- You're not staying?

691
00:47:23,426 --> 00:47:25,566
- Nope, I've got to haul horses
up to the Yellowstone

692
00:47:25,566 --> 00:47:28,431
then Ft. Worth
for the Snaffle Bit.

693
00:47:28,431 --> 00:47:29,605
- Well, where do I go?

694
00:47:29,605 --> 00:47:31,952
- Doc said to go out
back by the corrals.

695
00:47:33,885 --> 00:47:35,473
- Where's the back?

696
00:47:35,473 --> 00:47:37,889
- Well, Jimmy, if this
is the front,

697
00:47:37,889 --> 00:47:39,926
then the back is the exact
opposite of this.

698
00:47:41,962 --> 00:47:43,205
That make sense?
- Yeah.

699
00:47:43,205 --> 00:47:46,449
- All right, well...
Good luck, Jimmy.

700
00:47:46,449 --> 00:47:48,106
- Thought you said luck has
nothing to do with it.

701
00:47:48,106 --> 00:47:50,660
- No, I said luck has nothing
to do with horse showing.

702
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,904
For this, you're going to need
all the luck you can get.

703
00:47:52,904 --> 00:47:53,871
See you around.
