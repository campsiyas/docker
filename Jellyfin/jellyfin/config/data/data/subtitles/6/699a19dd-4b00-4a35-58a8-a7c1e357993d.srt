00:00:35,966 --> 00:00:38,348
What the hell are you doing?

3
00:00:38,383 --> 00:00:39,660
Packing.

4
00:00:39,694 --> 00:00:42,490
You know, I can see that.
But, where are you going?

5
00:00:42,525 --> 00:00:44,354
I don't know.

6
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:47,495
Livingston for a few days
while I figure it out.

7
00:00:48,565 --> 00:00:50,567
Why?

8
00:00:51,672 --> 00:00:54,606
Because I sacrificed
his little lamb.

9
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,159
What the hell does
that mean, Beth?

10
00:00:56,194 --> 00:00:59,335
Doesn't matter.
He doesn't want me here.

11
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:01,682
And if I've learned
anything about life, it is

12
00:01:01,716 --> 00:01:04,133
not to be somewhere
where you aren't wanted.

13
00:01:04,167 --> 00:01:07,688
Mm-hmm, well, guess what?
You're wanted.

14
00:01:07,722 --> 00:01:09,172
Not by him.

15
00:01:09,207 --> 00:01:10,829
- Beth?
- Yeah.

16
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:12,865
You just put that down for...
Beth?

17
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,419
Just stop.

18
00:01:14,453 --> 00:01:15,903
I...

19
00:01:17,318 --> 00:01:19,355
I thought we made
a promise to each other.

20
00:01:26,258 --> 00:01:27,466
Hey...

21
00:01:29,572 --> 00:01:33,334
You can run away and then wander
back in a few years

22
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:34,715
and think that
everything's gonna be the same,

23
00:01:34,749 --> 00:01:35,992
but it won't.

24
00:01:38,408 --> 00:01:41,273
I mean, he might be gone.

25
00:01:41,308 --> 00:01:44,552
Shit, this ranch
might be gone.

26
00:01:44,587 --> 00:01:47,037
And when it's gone,
baby, I'm gone.

27
00:01:51,283 --> 00:01:52,871
You break your promise to me...

28
00:01:56,668 --> 00:01:57,772
and it stays broken.

29
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:28,009
I'm sorry. I didn't know
what she meant to you.

30
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,291
It's not what she means to me,
honey, it's...

31
00:02:34,706 --> 00:02:36,294
It's what's right.
What's decent.

32
00:02:38,744 --> 00:02:42,783
No rules with our enemies,
but she isn't an enemy.

33
00:02:42,817 --> 00:02:46,131
Well, that's an argument
for another time.

34
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:50,031
But... your ranch, your rules.

35
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:53,587
I fight how you say fight.

36
00:03:01,698 --> 00:03:03,113
I'd like to stay.

37
00:03:06,841 --> 00:03:09,672
This is your home.

38
00:03:09,706 --> 00:03:11,674
You don't need
my permission to live here.

39
00:03:13,227 --> 00:03:14,366
For me, I do.

40
00:03:17,266 --> 00:03:18,750
Then you have it.

41
00:03:23,306 --> 00:03:24,687
Thank you.

42
00:03:27,586 --> 00:03:28,863
Beth...

43
00:03:28,898 --> 00:03:30,555
Yeah?

44
00:03:33,385 --> 00:03:36,319
I love you, okay?

45
00:03:37,562 --> 00:03:39,149
That never changes.

46
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,793
Morning, Mama.

47
00:04:36,828 --> 00:04:37,967
Hey, baby.

48
00:04:45,388 --> 00:04:46,493
You can't call me that.

49
00:04:49,116 --> 00:04:50,117
Why not?

50
00:04:52,706 --> 00:04:54,155
Because it's not true.

51
00:04:56,641 --> 00:05:00,679
I just thought 'cause I don't
have one, you could be it.

52
00:05:05,235 --> 00:05:06,236
You been acting like it.

53
00:05:08,653 --> 00:05:11,380
I've been acting like your
friend, which is what I am.

54
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:16,316
You lost your mother, kid.

55
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,352
You don't get another.

56
00:05:18,387 --> 00:05:21,355
I lost mine.
Same goes for me.

57
00:05:22,736 --> 00:05:26,222
And I'm nobody's mother. Ever.
You got it?

58
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:34,264
Crying doesn't help.

59
00:05:40,236 --> 00:05:41,306
Never does.

60
00:06:00,774 --> 00:06:02,362
You were in prison?

61
00:06:05,123 --> 00:06:06,849
Yeah.

62
00:06:06,883 --> 00:06:11,923
Explain that to me.
Explain prison.

63
00:06:11,957 --> 00:06:13,442
What part?

64
00:06:13,476 --> 00:06:15,064
Could you have visitors?

65
00:06:17,342 --> 00:06:20,897
I didn't have any,
but I guess I could have.

66
00:06:22,934 --> 00:06:25,315
Wives?
Girlfriends, they can visit?

67
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,386
Yeah.

68
00:06:28,836 --> 00:06:33,703
Can they do more?
Like, conjugals?

69
00:06:33,738 --> 00:06:35,360
Yeah, you can do that.

70
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,189
You just got to
reserve a room.

71
00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:41,711
One last question...

72
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:45,094
how do I get a weapon in?

73
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,237
What kind of weapon?

74
00:06:51,687 --> 00:06:53,102
One that doesn't
look like a weapon.

75
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:02,525
Them hair pins
are pretty good.

76
00:07:06,253 --> 00:07:08,531
Just got to give the guards
something else to look at...

77
00:07:11,016 --> 00:07:13,329
I reckon they wouldn't be
too concerned about your hair.

78
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,267
Thank you.

79
00:07:33,763 --> 00:07:35,593
What in the fuck
was that about, Walker?

80
00:07:37,802 --> 00:07:40,183
She was asking me
about prison.

81
00:07:40,218 --> 00:07:41,840
Prison?

82
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,187
Yeah. Think she wants
to kill somebody.

83
00:07:45,706 --> 00:07:48,260
Whatever she told you,
you don't tell anybody else.

84
00:07:48,295 --> 00:07:49,641
You understand me?

85
00:07:49,676 --> 00:07:50,918
Yeah, I got that.

86
00:07:59,962 --> 00:08:01,032
Hey.

87
00:08:03,344 --> 00:08:04,967
What are you doing?

88
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:08,936
My last act before
the kinder, gentler me appears.

89
00:08:08,971 --> 00:08:10,904
I don't need you getting
in trouble, Beth,

90
00:08:10,938 --> 00:08:12,008
or hurt or killed.

91
00:08:12,043 --> 00:08:14,045
If you need something
taken care of

92
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,391
you tell me
and I'll take care of it.

93
00:08:15,425 --> 00:08:16,426
I know, baby.

94
00:08:17,842 --> 00:08:19,326
But this one's just for me.

95
00:08:20,638 --> 00:08:21,604
Okay?

96
00:08:23,951 --> 00:08:25,574
I love you.

97
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:48,259
All right, let's not
overbet the pot here.

98
00:11:48,293 --> 00:11:49,674
40.

99
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,848
Shit.

100
00:11:50,882 --> 00:11:52,608
Betting like
you made the flush.

101
00:11:52,642 --> 00:11:54,196
That's because
I did make the flush.

102
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,025
If you made the flush
you would be acting

103
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,544
like you didn't
make the flush.

104
00:11:57,578 --> 00:12:00,064
You're just trying to put me
off of my flush.

105
00:12:00,098 --> 00:12:01,444
That is
absolutely ass backwards.

106
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:02,825
I am begging you
to match the pot.

107
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,654
Begging you.
Daddy needs a new pair of shoes.

108
00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:05,863
Let me see.
Let me see your face.

109
00:12:05,897 --> 00:12:07,312
You are so full of shit again.

110
00:12:07,347 --> 00:12:08,520
You are bluffing.

111
00:12:08,555 --> 00:12:10,039
If he's bluffing
why are you folding?

112
00:12:10,074 --> 00:12:11,247
I ain't got shit either.

113
00:12:11,282 --> 00:12:12,766
I am bluffing.

114
00:12:12,801 --> 00:12:15,873
- You know what? I'm going to raise you 40...
- Woo!

115
00:12:15,907 --> 00:12:18,082
'cause you're lying
and that's not nice.

116
00:12:18,116 --> 00:12:20,532
Go, girl!

117
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:23,156
Let's put the man
to a decision.

118
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,847
I've already made my decision.

119
00:12:24,882 --> 00:12:26,055
I'm all in.

120
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,091
Me too.

121
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,644
Turn 'em over.

122
00:12:28,678 --> 00:12:29,645
- Let's see 'em.
- Bye.

123
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:31,302
Oh!

124
00:12:31,336 --> 00:12:32,475
Ace, king, seven, Jack.

125
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:35,582
Okay, so you weren't lying...
All right.

126
00:12:35,616 --> 00:12:38,205
But, gee, and all I have
is this Ace and Seven.

127
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,968
Woo!

128
00:12:42,002 --> 00:12:44,867
She went and dry fucked 'em
right there, didn't she?

129
00:12:44,902 --> 00:12:45,765
Yes, she did.

130
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,007
Didn't you three
girls get fired?

131
00:12:47,042 --> 00:12:48,560
He didn't say
we couldn't come back.

132
00:12:48,595 --> 00:12:50,079
That's exactly what it means
when you get fired,

133
00:12:50,114 --> 00:12:51,563
it means you are not supposed
to come back ever.

134
00:12:51,598 --> 00:12:53,186
So, if I get
fired from McDonald's,

135
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,808
I can't ever go
back to McDonald's

136
00:12:54,843 --> 00:12:56,361
and get something to eat?
- She's got a point.

137
00:12:56,396 --> 00:12:58,743
She'd have a point
if we sold hamburgers, Lloyd.

138
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,608
Technically, we kind of
do make hamburgers.

139
00:13:01,642 --> 00:13:05,060
- Hey!
- Well, well, well...

140
00:13:05,094 --> 00:13:06,199
It's the Texican.

141
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:08,235
- Look who it is?
- How y'all doing?

142
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,616
Everyone's great, Jimmy.

143
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,963
Everyone except for Ryan.
- Fuck you.

144
00:13:11,998 --> 00:13:13,516
You can always do one of
those payday loans.

145
00:13:13,551 --> 00:13:17,555
You can see things haven't
changed here. Pull up a chair.

146
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,971
Actually, uh...
I'm gonna need two chairs.

147
00:13:20,006 --> 00:13:21,524
- Why?
- Oh.

148
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,184
Ruh roh.

149
00:13:26,219 --> 00:13:28,842
Oh, that's gonna go over
like a fart in church.

150
00:13:28,877 --> 00:13:30,602
Everyone, this is Emily.

151
00:13:30,637 --> 00:13:32,984
She's a vet down the Sixes.
And, uh...

152
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:34,675
She's my fiancée.

153
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:35,815
Oh, shit.

154
00:13:40,405 --> 00:13:43,788
No, no, no no!
No fighting!

155
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,618
Let them fight,
they don't even work here.

156
00:13:46,653 --> 00:13:48,620
- Kick her fucking ass!
- Just let them fight.

157
00:13:50,795 --> 00:13:52,866
- Emily! Emily! Emily!
- Oh!

158
00:13:52,901 --> 00:13:54,730
- I got $20 on Texas.
- Yeah!

159
00:13:54,764 --> 00:13:58,803
No, no, no, no!

160
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,081
Fucking barrel racers.

161
00:14:01,116 --> 00:14:02,807
- That's enough, come on!
- Fuck you!

162
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,464
Fuck!

163
00:14:04,498 --> 00:14:07,950
Whoa. Whoa.

164
00:14:07,985 --> 00:14:10,470
- Frickin' mess!
- Well, shit!

165
00:14:10,504 --> 00:14:13,438
Always good to exercise
after a long drive.

166
00:14:13,473 --> 00:14:14,957
What're the chances
there's some whiskey in here?

167
00:14:14,992 --> 00:14:17,235
- Chances are good.
- Chances are good.

168
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,824
Nice hook.

169
00:14:24,518 --> 00:14:26,486
Looks like this one's free.

170
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,521
It is now.

171
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:32,457
- What's the game?
- Whatever you want it to be.

172
00:14:32,492 --> 00:14:34,494
Let me fucking go!

173
00:14:36,772 --> 00:14:38,084
How fucking dare
you bring her here?

174
00:14:38,118 --> 00:14:39,361
How was I supposed
to know you're going to be here?

175
00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:40,949
You don't fucking work here!

176
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,332
You said you were
done with me.

177
00:14:45,367 --> 00:14:46,678
And now it's the
other way around.

178
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,475
Yeah.

179
00:14:52,995 --> 00:14:55,377
God. You didn't fight.

180
00:14:55,411 --> 00:14:56,654
Not even a little.

181
00:14:57,793 --> 00:14:58,932
I took you at your word.

182
00:15:00,623 --> 00:15:04,179
You said that if I left
we were through. I left.

183
00:15:04,213 --> 00:15:05,525
And I met her.

184
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:08,769
And I...
And I fell in love.

185
00:15:08,804 --> 00:15:10,806
And when I had to leave there
and come back here

186
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,913
she chose an option that

187
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:15,086
she chose to come with me.

188
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,813
So, it's my fault.

189
00:15:20,436 --> 00:15:21,437
It's nobody's fault.

190
00:15:23,025 --> 00:15:24,578
I had a lot of growing up to do.

191
00:15:24,613 --> 00:15:26,995
I wish that I'd done it before
you and I met, but I didn't.

192
00:15:31,482 --> 00:15:33,242
Okay.

193
00:15:33,277 --> 00:15:35,762
Just forget everything that's
happened before right now.

194
00:15:35,796 --> 00:15:36,797
All right. Choose.

195
00:15:37,798 --> 00:15:39,662
Choose.
Her or me.

196
00:15:39,697 --> 00:15:40,698
- Mia...
- Choose!

197
00:15:53,883 --> 00:15:55,955
Take me home, Laramie.

198
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:11,763
I'm sorry, sir.
I didn't see you there.

199
00:16:14,283 --> 00:16:17,286
Walked down to see the horse.

200
00:16:17,321 --> 00:16:19,806
Didn't seem
like a conversation

201
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,359
I wanted to interrupt.

202
00:16:21,394 --> 00:16:23,879
Well, to be honest, I wouldn't
have minded the interruption.

203
00:16:25,122 --> 00:16:27,365
Yeah.
It, uh...

204
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,435
It had that look.

205
00:16:30,748 --> 00:16:32,336
Come on.

206
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,854
Come show me the horse.

207
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,050
You want me to take
that blanket off him?

208
00:16:57,085 --> 00:16:58,051
Nah.

209
00:17:00,295 --> 00:17:03,574
You know, I've never figured
out a way to look at one

210
00:17:03,608 --> 00:17:05,852
and know if it had
a shred of talent or heart.

211
00:17:07,095 --> 00:17:10,167
But if you look
at all this horse has done,

212
00:17:10,201 --> 00:17:11,892
and all his babies have done...

213
00:17:13,894 --> 00:17:16,966
I guess that's what
talent and heart looks like.

214
00:17:21,454 --> 00:17:25,216
I see you drove up
here in the four sixes truck.

215
00:17:25,251 --> 00:17:27,356
Yes, sir.

216
00:17:27,391 --> 00:17:29,220
My fiancee'll drive it back
with her when she goes.

217
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,258
Fiancée.

218
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,365
Yes, sir.

219
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,436
Oh.

220
00:17:38,471 --> 00:17:41,715
Now the fiancee's gonna
drive back

221
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,408
and you're not going with her?

222
00:17:45,892 --> 00:17:48,446
I'm going to work off
what I owe you.

223
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:49,585
Then we'll figure it out.

224
00:17:51,173 --> 00:17:56,075
So the wedding's gonna
be in, what, 75 years?

225
00:18:00,976 --> 00:18:02,357
I broke my word to you once.

226
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,292
Almost did it again
to stay with her.

227
00:18:08,811 --> 00:18:10,399
No, I'm going to pay you
what I owe.

228
00:18:12,332 --> 00:18:14,162
Texas was good for you.

229
00:18:15,646 --> 00:18:17,786
Yes, sir, I think it was.

230
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,620
Only person you owe
is yourself, Jim.

231
00:18:27,796 --> 00:18:29,763
You don't owe me a thing.

232
00:18:32,628 --> 00:18:35,114
Thank you, sir.

233
00:18:40,188 --> 00:18:42,051
No matter what you decide,
or...

234
00:18:43,536 --> 00:18:47,609
how it works out, you
always have a place right here.

235
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,569
You're not doing
what he asked.

236
00:19:22,575 --> 00:19:26,441
He said pray for a vision.

237
00:19:26,475 --> 00:19:28,270
But I don't see you praying.

238
00:19:35,622 --> 00:19:37,003
So... What are you doing here?

239
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,041
You need help?

240
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:47,565
Let me in.
I can help you.

241
00:19:51,051 --> 00:19:52,191
I can't.

242
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,403
Just open the doors.

243
00:20:02,442 --> 00:20:05,687
They told me not to.

244
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,311
I'm your brother.

245
00:20:10,726 --> 00:20:11,727
Let me help you.

246
00:20:17,595 --> 00:20:18,976
They won't let me.

247
00:20:22,807 --> 00:20:25,224
Let me in, you fucking child!
Look at me!

248
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:27,122
This is your vision!

249
00:20:27,156 --> 00:20:29,158
This is your destiny!

250
00:20:30,746 --> 00:20:32,403
Baby, shh.

251
00:20:32,438 --> 00:20:34,302
It's just a dream.

252
00:20:34,336 --> 00:20:36,096
Shhhh.

253
00:20:44,381 --> 00:20:45,623
It's just a dream.

254
00:21:36,433 --> 00:21:38,849
Hey, start looking
for that son of a bitch!

255
00:21:38,883 --> 00:21:40,437
He might be laid up
in them trees

256
00:21:40,471 --> 00:21:42,784
or that deep grass over there.

257
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:43,888
I got him.

258
00:21:46,374 --> 00:21:48,479
You weren't in
Texas that long.

259
00:21:48,514 --> 00:21:49,860
Let him try, Lloyd,
let him try.

260
00:21:49,894 --> 00:21:51,102
Go on, Jimmy.

261
00:22:07,671 --> 00:22:09,535
He didn't run like
he has pneumonia, did he?

262
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:11,122
No, Jimmy.
He sure didn't.

263
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:16,921
Let him go.

264
00:22:16,956 --> 00:22:18,785
You toss one hell
of a loop, Jimmy.

265
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,168
Yeah, you may make
a team roper yet.

266
00:22:22,202 --> 00:22:23,687
Spend enough time roping
during the day

267
00:22:23,721 --> 00:22:25,654
I don't have to go waste my
nights doing it.

268
00:22:25,689 --> 00:22:26,931
That's like a dentist
going home

269
00:22:26,966 --> 00:22:28,001
and looking at
pictures of teeth.

270
00:22:28,036 --> 00:22:29,348
Whatever you say, Tex.

271
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:34,974
I'll be damned. Look who went
off and become a cowboy.

272
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:38,426
Yeah, it seems that way,
doesn't it, Lloyd?

273
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:41,705
Any more in here?

274
00:22:41,739 --> 00:22:42,982
I don't believe so.

275
00:22:43,016 --> 00:22:45,674
Let's just do a little
once-over though, yeah?

276
00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:46,986
Okay.

277
00:22:55,995 --> 00:22:58,273
When people come here,

278
00:22:58,307 --> 00:23:01,207
they expect their opponents
to be a bunch of rednecks.

279
00:23:01,241 --> 00:23:04,210
People of the land,
I guess you could say...

280
00:23:05,349 --> 00:23:06,971
They don't expect you.

281
00:23:07,006 --> 00:23:08,904
They don't expect a fight.

282
00:23:08,939 --> 00:23:10,596
That's why you have been

283
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,771
such an effective
nuisance for so long.

284
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:18,949
I, however, was aware
of just what a huge problem

285
00:23:18,983 --> 00:23:21,054
you could be.
I was prepared...

286
00:23:21,089 --> 00:23:24,368
I gave you enough rope
to hang yourself,

287
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,682
and oh boy did you
fucking hang yourself.

288
00:23:27,716 --> 00:23:31,962
You have violated everything

289
00:23:31,996 --> 00:23:34,827
from the terms of your
contract to your NDA.

290
00:23:34,861 --> 00:23:39,038
You have committed
corporate espionage.

291
00:23:43,042 --> 00:23:45,734
I don't know
anything about that.

292
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:49,186
Look at the ease
with which you lie.

293
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:53,362
Do you think I don't know
anyone at the Times?

294
00:23:53,397 --> 00:23:55,882
We own that fucking building!

295
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,749
What do you
suppose we'll find

296
00:24:00,784 --> 00:24:04,408
when I subpoena the little
hippie's call records?

297
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,961
And the reporters.

298
00:24:05,996 --> 00:24:07,618
Good luck with that.

299
00:24:07,653 --> 00:24:09,586
First Amendment and all...

300
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,592
I manage the largest private
fund in the world.

301
00:24:15,626 --> 00:24:17,456
And you know what you've done?

302
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,389
You've made it personal for me.

303
00:24:20,424 --> 00:24:24,186
I don't care how much we spend,
or how long it takes,

304
00:24:24,221 --> 00:24:30,330
I'm gonna put a public restroom
where your fucking house is.

305
00:24:30,365 --> 00:24:35,508
I'm gonna chop down every tree,
and dam every creek.

306
00:24:35,543 --> 00:24:40,513
I am going to rape
your fucking ranch to death.

307
00:24:40,548 --> 00:24:45,691
And you, you little bitch,
are going to prison.

308
00:24:48,452 --> 00:24:50,419
Needless to say, you're fired.

309
00:25:04,813 --> 00:25:06,539
Gonna be late for my date.

310
00:25:12,718 --> 00:25:14,685
See ya, Cal.

311
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,791
You've been as
uninteresting as I expected.

312
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,518
Ma'am?

313
00:25:30,356 --> 00:25:31,909
John Dutton here to see you.

314
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:34,325
Send him in.

315
00:25:35,913 --> 00:25:36,914
Thank you.

316
00:25:38,744 --> 00:25:41,505
John.

317
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,886
Hello, Mitch.

318
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,751
You walk pretty good
for a man who got shot.

319
00:25:45,785 --> 00:25:48,374
I play eighteen holes,
I can't walk for a month.

320
00:25:48,408 --> 00:25:50,514
Well, it's been
a few months now.

321
00:25:53,172 --> 00:25:54,414
I stand corrected.

322
00:25:54,449 --> 00:25:56,278
Have a seat.

323
00:25:56,313 --> 00:25:57,590
What can I do for you?

324
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,871
I wanna talk about
this Summer Higgins case.

325
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,254
You know her?

326
00:26:06,288 --> 00:26:08,221
Little bit.

327
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,396
From what I know
she's not a criminal.

328
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:12,640
Overly passionate, maybe...

329
00:26:12,674 --> 00:26:16,126
John, she's an
environmental terrorist.

330
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,922
Forty-two arrests
in a dozen states.

331
00:26:18,956 --> 00:26:21,027
I've put many an
armed robber in prison,

332
00:26:21,062 --> 00:26:23,409
they're equally as passionate
about their position.

333
00:26:23,443 --> 00:26:25,929
But because these people
think that their cause

334
00:26:25,963 --> 00:26:27,620
has some moral high ground

335
00:26:27,655 --> 00:26:29,622
they think the laws
don't apply to them.

336
00:26:29,657 --> 00:26:32,073
But the laws
they break are still broken.

337
00:26:32,107 --> 00:26:33,557
An officer was still assaulted,

338
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,559
land was still vandalized,

339
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,803
and property was
still destroyed.

340
00:26:37,837 --> 00:26:40,495
My obligation is
to the rule of law,

341
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:42,601
which is eroding everywhere.

342
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:46,087
Not here.
Not on my watch.

343
00:26:46,121 --> 00:26:47,847
So you're willing
to send her to prison

344
00:26:47,882 --> 00:26:49,400
for the rest of her life?

345
00:26:49,435 --> 00:26:53,404
I instructed council on both
sides to ignore her motivation,

346
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:55,579
focus on the damage,

347
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,443
and bring me a plea
agreement with some weight.

348
00:27:00,446 --> 00:27:02,966
But you speaking
on her behalf has weight too,

349
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,623
and I'll take it
into consideration.

350
00:27:08,523 --> 00:27:09,524
I appreciate it, Mitch.

351
00:27:11,664 --> 00:27:14,460
John,

352
00:27:16,462 --> 00:27:17,636
she is going to prison.

353
00:27:18,913 --> 00:27:20,880
Only thing to debate
is how long.

354
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:48,149
What the fuck is this?

355
00:27:48,183 --> 00:27:49,391
It's your conjugal.

356
00:27:49,426 --> 00:27:51,808
I don't have
a fucking conjugal.

357
00:27:51,842 --> 00:27:53,050
We can take you back
to your cell if you want.

358
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,915
Let me figure this out.

359
00:28:13,381 --> 00:28:15,763
Well, this place
is depressing as hell.

360
00:28:16,936 --> 00:28:18,282
It's prison.

361
00:28:19,456 --> 00:28:21,113
It's all depressing.

362
00:28:21,147 --> 00:28:24,116
I'd love to shine
a blue light on that couch.

363
00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:28,430
Who are you?

364
00:28:30,467 --> 00:28:32,641
I'm one of the people
you tried to kill.

365
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,541
I don't know you
to want to kill you.

366
00:28:39,372 --> 00:28:41,064
You tried to kill my father.

367
00:28:41,098 --> 00:28:43,204
And my brother.

368
00:28:45,102 --> 00:28:46,172
You're a Dutton.

369
00:28:46,207 --> 00:28:47,553
Bingo.

370
00:28:49,072 --> 00:28:53,524
Look, like I told the other
the order came in.

371
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:54,836
I sent it out.

372
00:28:54,871 --> 00:28:56,976
For me, it's just business.

373
00:28:58,046 --> 00:28:59,323
What other guy?

374
00:28:59,358 --> 00:29:02,430
The suit.
The lawyer.

375
00:29:02,464 --> 00:29:03,776
The one in the papers.

376
00:29:07,607 --> 00:29:08,850
This lawyer?

377
00:29:08,885 --> 00:29:10,576
That's the one.

378
00:29:26,695 --> 00:29:28,939
You know you're going
to die here, right?

379
00:29:30,216 --> 00:29:32,391
Yep.

380
00:29:32,425 --> 00:29:36,257
When you're old and weak
and you can barely take a piss

381
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:38,915
and it's been so long since
you had any decent food

382
00:29:38,949 --> 00:29:42,504
that you actually look forward
to the fish fry on Fridays

383
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:45,438
and you're waiting to die
and everyone that you've known

384
00:29:45,473 --> 00:29:49,235
is gone or forgotten you,

385
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,650
you will realize...

386
00:29:54,033 --> 00:29:56,139
they have you perfectly trained.

387
00:30:03,284 --> 00:30:07,667
Trained to stand up,
trained to sit down,

388
00:30:07,702 --> 00:30:10,739
trained to line up,
trained to sleep.

389
00:30:12,327 --> 00:30:16,090
And you will realize
that your time on this planet

390
00:30:16,124 --> 00:30:19,438
has been an utter waste
and failure.

391
00:30:19,472 --> 00:30:23,373
And you will know
in your heart

392
00:30:23,407 --> 00:30:26,031
that this world would have been
a better place without you.

393
00:30:28,965 --> 00:30:32,106
And then you'll
remember me telling you.

394
00:30:39,734 --> 00:30:42,288
You know, life isn't
a longevity contest.

395
00:30:47,466 --> 00:30:50,710
what good you can get from life,
what good you can give it.

396
00:30:50,745 --> 00:30:53,437
And your life is already over.

397
00:30:53,472 --> 00:30:55,163
You're just waiting to die.

398
00:31:00,134 --> 00:31:02,274
I hope you wait
'til you're a hundred.

399
00:31:15,494 --> 00:31:17,392
Hey, sweet tits,
you ain't ropin'?

400
00:31:17,427 --> 00:31:19,187
We're on cooler patrol.

401
00:31:19,222 --> 00:31:20,602
Come on, don't be intimidated.

402
00:31:20,637 --> 00:31:22,225
You gotta come up here,
an rope with mama.

403
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:24,296
Yeah, get out there
and rope with mama,

404
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:25,573
this cooler's gonna be
safe with me.

405
00:31:25,607 --> 00:31:26,712
That joke's getting old.

406
00:31:26,746 --> 00:31:28,403
- Not even a little.
- No, it's super old.

407
00:31:28,438 --> 00:31:30,923
They age like fine wine.

408
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:32,994
There's turtles that live
two hundred and fifty years.

409
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:35,307
Your jokes are older...

410
00:31:35,341 --> 00:31:36,860

He's a hand, ain't he?

439
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:50,969

Cats are barking.

443
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,254
A barrel racer girl
just called us crazy.

444
00:33:00,288 --> 00:33:02,290
Yeah, I know.

445
00:33:02,325 --> 00:33:04,016
I just don't know
how to respond.

446
00:33:10,643 --> 00:33:11,886
Caught one for you.

447
00:33:15,407 --> 00:33:17,133
How the fuck you'd hurt your
knee roping a steer?

448
00:33:17,167 --> 00:33:18,341
I didn't hurt it
roping the steers.

449
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:20,584
I hurt it fucking your mother
the other night.

450
00:33:20,619 --> 00:33:22,897
Fuck you, first Jimmy,
now you're all fucked up.

451
00:33:22,931 --> 00:33:24,795

00:33:28,316 --> 00:33:30,008
- Sorry, Gator.
- Calm down, Gator.

455
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:31,423
Have some fucking whiskey.
We're coming.

456
00:33:31,457 --> 00:33:32,700
Come on, drink up.

457
00:33:32,734 --> 00:33:35,703
Bring the whiskey out here!

458
00:33:35,737 --> 00:33:37,705
You happy?

459
00:33:37,739 --> 00:33:39,776
I know who I am now.

460
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:42,020
Or at least what I want to do.
And who I want to do it with.

461
00:33:44,608 --> 00:33:47,025
What do you want to do?

462
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:49,303
String together a whole
lifetime of days like today.

463
00:33:51,615 --> 00:33:52,858
It's hard to do.

464
00:33:54,342 --> 00:33:58,726
No.
No, it's hard to do here.

465
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,590
This job's hard enough
without having to fight

466
00:34:00,624 --> 00:34:03,248
the whole world
for the right to do it.

467
00:34:03,282 --> 00:34:05,008
Texas...

468
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,286
I'm not fighting the neighbor
to do my job

469
00:34:07,321 --> 00:34:09,564
because he's got
the same job.

470
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:10,738
And so does his neighbor.

471
00:34:12,257 --> 00:34:14,500
It's just cattle and cowboys
all the way to the horizon.

472
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:21,300
You're going back to Texas,
ain't you?

473
00:34:25,511 --> 00:34:26,823
I'm not much of a fighter.

474
00:34:28,652 --> 00:34:29,964
I might make a cowboy yet.

475
00:34:35,038 --> 00:34:38,938
Hell, Jimmy,
You're a cowboy already.

476
00:34:51,296 --> 00:34:52,918
Good luck.

477
00:35:47,075 --> 00:35:48,594
Did you try calling her?

478
00:35:48,629 --> 00:35:49,768
Yeah, she didn't answer.

479
00:35:53,012 --> 00:35:54,186
Should I be worried?

480
00:35:54,221 --> 00:35:56,154
Think I'm worried
enough for both of us.

481
00:36:01,262 --> 00:36:03,057
Sorry I'm late.

482
00:36:03,091 --> 00:36:06,992
So, before dinner I've got a
little business to take care of.

483
00:36:09,132 --> 00:36:10,306
Everybody outside.

484
00:36:13,688 --> 00:36:14,965
What business, honey?

485
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,105
Everybody out, come on!

486
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,141
Outside.

487
00:36:19,591 --> 00:36:20,557
Come on, let's go.

488
00:36:27,909 --> 00:36:29,083
Give me a hand, would ya?

489
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,292
Beth...

490
00:36:32,914 --> 00:36:34,847
What the hell
are you doing?

491
00:36:34,882 --> 00:36:37,056
There's something
that I gotta do tomorrow, Dad,

492
00:36:37,091 --> 00:36:39,818
and I want to be a
married woman when I do it.

493
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:46,204
Honey, let's do this right.

494
00:36:46,238 --> 00:36:47,446
Let me plan--

495
00:36:47,481 --> 00:36:49,862
I don't give a shit
about the wedding, Dad.

496
00:36:49,897 --> 00:36:51,761
I just care about the marriage.

497
00:36:51,795 --> 00:36:54,350
Sweetheart, that's a priest.

498
00:36:54,384 --> 00:36:55,592
We aren't fucking Catholic.

499
00:36:57,111 --> 00:36:58,077
I don't care.

500
00:36:58,112 --> 00:36:59,769
He can sign the thing, right?

501
00:36:59,803 --> 00:37:01,149
That's all that matters...

502
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:10,918
We're getting married.

503
00:37:12,816 --> 00:37:14,301
You okay with this?

504
00:37:14,335 --> 00:37:18,305
Beth, you are so
fucking crazy.

505
00:37:18,339 --> 00:37:21,549
I thought you wanted to find
a place that was just ours.

506
00:37:21,584 --> 00:37:22,619
I do.

507
00:37:24,172 --> 00:37:25,967
We will take that ride,
I promise.

508
00:37:28,073 --> 00:37:30,144
Sweetheart, if it makes
you happy, I'm happy.

509
00:37:32,111 --> 00:37:33,596
There's two things
I gotta grab real quick.

510
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,425
Just give me one second,
all right?

511
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,599
Be right back.

512
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:39,912
Look, I'm just sayin'
it's not chili.

513
00:37:39,947 --> 00:37:42,398
- It's chili.
- It's got beans in it.

514
00:37:42,432 --> 00:37:44,227
The whole point of chili
is to use up all the shit

515
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,746
you got in you kitchen, you can
put anything you want in it.

516
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,057
No, no, that's stew.

517
00:37:47,092 --> 00:37:49,197
As soon as you put beans
in chili it ain't chili.

518
00:37:49,232 --> 00:37:50,785
Then what the fuck
do they call this in Texas?

519
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,304
They don't call it anything
because it doesn't exist,

520
00:37:52,339 --> 00:37:53,305
it's got beans in it.

521
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,858
They don't eat beans in Texas.

522
00:37:54,893 --> 00:37:56,377
They eat beans all day they
just don't eat them in chili.

523
00:37:56,412 --> 00:37:58,034
So why the fuck does
Texas get to decide

524
00:37:58,068 --> 00:38:00,036
what the fuck goes in chili?
- Because they invented it.

525
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,796
Will y'all shut the fuck up?

526
00:38:01,831 --> 00:38:04,109
I can't eat whatever
the fuck you call it

527
00:38:04,143 --> 00:38:06,111
with you assholes jabbering.

528
00:38:06,145 --> 00:38:08,251
It's good,
it's just not chili.

529
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,667
Lloyd. I need you.
Grab your stuff, will you?

530
00:38:10,702 --> 00:38:11,875
Hey, Rip, will you tell them?

531
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,014
If you put beans in chili,
is it still chili?

532
00:38:13,049 --> 00:38:14,119
Jimmy, shut the fuck up.

533
00:38:14,153 --> 00:38:16,224
Nobody cares about
your goddamn chili.

534
00:38:16,259 --> 00:38:19,297
Yeah, fuck you, Jimmy.
You still owe me a rope.

535
00:38:19,331 --> 00:38:21,402
- Some things just never change.
- But I got to tell you...

536
00:38:21,437 --> 00:38:25,958
This is some damn good chili.

537
00:38:25,993 --> 00:38:28,029
You know, when your mom
makes chili, no beans.

538
00:38:28,064 --> 00:38:29,410
Don't start this shit again.

539
00:38:29,445 --> 00:38:31,412
I feel really bad,
I should have said something

540
00:38:31,447 --> 00:38:33,034
before we came.

541
00:38:33,069 --> 00:38:34,001
I had a very, very brief
relationship

542
00:38:34,035 --> 00:38:35,105
with Colby's mother.

543
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,728
- Here we go!
- It wasn't love.

544
00:38:36,762 --> 00:38:39,040
At least not for me.
I can't speak for her.

545
00:38:39,075 --> 00:38:40,594
It was very, very physical.

546
00:38:40,628 --> 00:38:41,733
Jimmy, I'm gonna
come across this table.

547
00:38:41,767 --> 00:38:42,941
Okay, I'm sorry.

548
00:38:42,975 --> 00:38:44,183
Although it's crazy
you would say that,

549
00:38:44,218 --> 00:38:45,806
that's exactly what
I did with your mom.

550
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,498
- Oh!
- That's it!

551
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,226
I'll break your neck again and
send you back to the hospital!

552
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,261
I'm sorry.

553
00:38:57,542 --> 00:38:59,095
Where we going?

554
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:00,855
Wedding.

555
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:02,201
Yours?

556
00:39:02,236 --> 00:39:04,134
Yes, sir.

557
00:39:04,169 --> 00:39:07,137
We ain't had
the bachelor party yet.

558
00:39:07,172 --> 00:39:09,588
Lloyd, we're doing
everything ass backwards, buddy.

559
00:39:09,623 --> 00:39:11,176
You'll be married
and we won't be able to do

560
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:12,867
any of the shit I'm planning.

561
00:39:14,179 --> 00:39:16,250
- The groom is...
- Big guy, black hat.

562
00:39:17,251 --> 00:39:19,736
So...
You stand here.

563
00:39:19,771 --> 00:39:22,463
And, uh...

564
00:39:22,498 --> 00:39:26,225
You'll take her hand
and walk her here to the...

565
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,572
What would be an altar.

566
00:39:27,606 --> 00:39:28,814
And you are...

567
00:39:28,849 --> 00:39:29,815
I'm the best man.

568
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:30,954
You stand beside him.

569
00:39:33,785 --> 00:39:35,545
I'm just the stall cleaner.

570
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,582
Stall cleaner
can stay where he is.

571
00:39:37,616 --> 00:39:39,929
And uh, here we go...

572
00:39:41,033 --> 00:39:42,380
Beth...

573
00:39:42,414 --> 00:39:45,175
Beth, you can't wear
that dress at your wedding.

574
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:47,902
Don't worry, Daddy.
I won't be wearing it long.

575
00:39:47,937 --> 00:39:50,698
Beth, I am not your buddy.
Okay, I'm your...

576
00:39:50,733 --> 00:39:52,113
I'm your father.

577
00:39:52,148 --> 00:39:54,702
So can you factor that in to
our conversations going forward?

578
00:39:54,737 --> 00:39:56,152
Okay.

579
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:00,190
- Ready?
- Yeah.

580
00:40:00,225 --> 00:40:02,917
I love you.

581
00:40:09,786 --> 00:40:11,305
Honey...

582
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:13,825
I hope you'll let me do
this again for you.

583
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:15,413
And do it right.

584
00:40:16,655 --> 00:40:18,554
You can do it
any way you want it.

585
00:40:19,762 --> 00:40:20,970
All right.

586
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,913
Who presents the bride?

587
00:40:32,947 --> 00:40:36,226
Me. I'm--I'm her father.

588
00:40:46,927 --> 00:40:50,275
So normally I would say a few
things about the couple,

589
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:53,347
but I don't have any
idea who you people are,

590
00:40:53,381 --> 00:40:56,454
so I will just move
onward to the vows.

591
00:41:01,217 --> 00:41:03,564
I, state your name...

592
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,497
I, Rip Wheeler...

593
00:41:05,532 --> 00:41:07,430
Do take...
state her name...

594
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,984
to be my lawful
wedded bride.

595
00:41:10,019 --> 00:41:13,401
Take Beth Dutton to be my
lawful wedded bride.

596
00:41:13,436 --> 00:41:17,302
To have and to hold,
to honor and cherish,

597
00:41:17,336 --> 00:41:18,786
from this day forward,

598
00:41:18,821 --> 00:41:22,100
for better or worse,
for richer or poorer,

599
00:41:22,134 --> 00:41:27,519
in sickness and in health,
until death do us part.

600
00:41:27,554 --> 00:41:31,074
To honor and to love

601
00:41:31,109 --> 00:41:34,492
to cherish through
everything...

602
00:41:34,526 --> 00:41:36,839
until I die.

603
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:40,152
And then somehow longer, baby.

604
00:41:43,259 --> 00:41:45,675
And now, Miss Dutton,

605
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:48,506
I, Beth Dutton--
- Fuck yes, I do.

606
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,784
Not yet, uhm...

607
00:41:52,544 --> 00:41:54,408
You do, I suppose.

608
00:41:55,754 --> 00:41:56,893
Are there rings?

609
00:41:56,928 --> 00:41:57,929
No rings.

610
00:41:57,963 --> 00:41:59,793
No, I have one.

611
00:42:00,932 --> 00:42:02,243
Here it is.

612
00:42:03,141 --> 00:42:04,660
What?

613
00:42:08,215 --> 00:42:10,389
It was my mother's ring.

614
00:42:10,424 --> 00:42:13,289
We didn't have much, Beth,
we were poor,

615
00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:15,463
but it's yours.

616
00:42:16,775 --> 00:42:18,570
So am I.

617
00:42:22,885 --> 00:42:25,439
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

618
00:42:31,894 --> 00:42:33,240
We're married.

619
00:42:36,726 --> 00:42:39,695
Thank you, uh...

620
00:42:39,729 --> 00:42:41,075
Thank you for
doing this, Father.

621
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:43,112
You're welcome.

622
00:42:43,146 --> 00:42:46,529
And don't worry,
I won't press charges.

623
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,186
Charges?

624
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,050
Sorry, Daddy.
I had to kidnap him.

625
00:42:51,603 --> 00:42:53,847
If I could get a ride
back to my church,

626
00:42:53,881 --> 00:42:56,504
I would appreciate it.
- Hold on. Hold on...

627
00:42:56,539 --> 00:42:59,473
How exactly did she kidnap you?

628
00:42:59,507 --> 00:43:02,683
- Pistol.
- It was just a little one.

629
00:43:03,995 --> 00:43:05,548
Tiny.
- Come on.

630
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:09,379
Jesus Christ.

631
00:43:09,414 --> 00:43:11,278
Excuse me, Father.

632
00:43:11,312 --> 00:43:12,728
Why don't I take
you home myself?

633
00:43:14,764 --> 00:43:16,801
Damn, that was beautiful.

634
00:43:16,835 --> 00:43:18,596
They all like that?

635
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:21,150
Hell, kid, ain't none
of 'em like that.

636
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,349
Hey.

637
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:52,560
Hey!

638
00:43:57,048 --> 00:43:58,808
What do you want from me?

639
00:45:22,547 --> 00:45:23,721
Give me eyes up top.

640
00:45:27,966 --> 00:45:30,866
Knight 33, this is Bravo One.

641
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,626
Be advised,
the beacon is in place.

642
00:47:36,094 --> 00:47:37,233
Thank you for coming.

643
00:47:37,268 --> 00:47:38,648
Did you talk to the judge?

644
00:47:38,683 --> 00:47:40,616
- We talked.
- And?

645
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:41,893
And he listened.

646
00:47:41,928 --> 00:47:43,619
We're about to find
out how much.

647
00:47:43,653 --> 00:47:45,034
All rise.

648
00:47:48,762 --> 00:47:50,695
The state of Montana
vs. Summer Higgins,

649
00:47:50,729 --> 00:47:52,421
Judge Mitchell
Davis presiding.

650
00:47:55,562 --> 00:47:58,082
Be seated.

651
00:47:58,116 --> 00:48:00,981
At the arraignment, your client
issued a plea of not guilty.

652
00:48:01,016 --> 00:48:02,534
Does your client wish
to change her plea?

653
00:48:02,569 --> 00:48:03,915
She does your honor.

654
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:05,192
If it please the court,
may council approach?

655
00:48:05,227 --> 00:48:06,400
Council may approach.

656
00:48:11,612 --> 00:48:13,097
They're entering
your plea agreement now.

657
00:48:13,131 --> 00:48:16,410
The judge will ask you
to reverse your plea.

658
00:48:16,445 --> 00:48:18,896
Once you do that, you are
at the mercy of the court.

659
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:21,070
No, we agreed
to a suspended sentence--

660
00:48:21,105 --> 00:48:24,694
No, your attorneys agreed.
Not the judge.

661
00:48:24,729 --> 00:48:26,627
The judge does
not have to honor it.

662
00:48:30,114 --> 00:48:31,080
What should I do?

663
00:48:33,082 --> 00:48:35,222
Summer, I...

664
00:48:35,257 --> 00:48:37,776
I trust a jury
more than I trust the judge.

665
00:48:37,811 --> 00:48:39,640
Will the defendant
please rise?

666
00:48:42,333 --> 00:48:45,025
Council has presented the court
with a plea agreement.

667
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:47,027
Are you aware of this agreement?

668
00:48:47,062 --> 00:48:48,615
I am your honor.

669
00:48:48,649 --> 00:48:50,272
Do you wish to change
your plea to guilty?

670
00:48:53,137 --> 00:48:54,828
I do, your honor.

671
00:48:54,862 --> 00:48:57,141
Your plea is changed
to a plea of guilty.

672
00:48:57,175 --> 00:49:00,213
In exchange for your plea
the State is offering

673
00:49:00,247 --> 00:49:02,560
a fifteen year
suspended sentence

674
00:49:02,594 --> 00:49:04,148
and a ten thousand dollar fine.

675
00:49:04,182 --> 00:49:05,563
Are you aware
of this plea offer?

676
00:49:05,597 --> 00:49:06,840
I am, your honor.

677
00:49:13,536 --> 00:49:17,885
When imposing a sentence,
this court must consider

678
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,923
many factors, motive
being one of them.

679
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,788
Many courts in the past
have confused your intentions

680
00:49:23,822 --> 00:49:25,583
with motive.

681
00:49:25,617 --> 00:49:30,001
Your intention, Miss Higgins,
may be to affect policy change,

682
00:49:30,036 --> 00:49:33,522
or bring awareness to issues.

683
00:49:33,556 --> 00:49:36,525
But that is not your motive.

684
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,458
That is not your motive
when you throw rocks

685
00:49:38,492 --> 00:49:40,218
and frozen water bottles.

686
00:49:40,253 --> 00:49:44,464
When you damage private property
and defy lawful orders.

687
00:49:44,498 --> 00:49:49,607
Your motive then
is to destroy and disrupt.

688
00:49:49,641 --> 00:49:54,681
And the result of that is
the erosion of the rule of law.

689
00:49:54,715 --> 00:49:58,271
When courts dismiss
your unlawful acts

690
00:49:58,305 --> 00:50:01,550
they are weakening
the rule of law,

691
00:50:01,584 --> 00:50:03,897
and creating avenues
of opportunity

692
00:50:03,931 --> 00:50:09,454
for people whose sole intent
is theft and violence.

693
00:50:09,489 --> 00:50:12,975
And they prey on the most
vulnerable in our society.

694
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:17,704
The elderly, the young,
the weak, the poor.

695
00:50:17,738 --> 00:50:21,121
They prey on those least likely
to recover from the attack.

696
00:50:21,156 --> 00:50:24,366
And you, Miss Higgins,
pave the way for them.

697
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,265
I am not swayed by
your college education

698
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,129
and your outreach work
in the community,

699
00:50:29,164 --> 00:50:31,442
in fact the opposite.

700
00:50:31,476 --> 00:50:33,340
You know better.

701
00:50:33,375 --> 00:50:35,549
If you wish to change laws,

702
00:50:35,584 --> 00:50:39,139
run for office or vote for those
who wish to change them as well.

703
00:50:39,174 --> 00:50:44,731
I look at your file
and I see a career criminal,

704
00:50:44,765 --> 00:50:47,285
who has deluded herself
into believing

705
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,562
that she is not
a criminal

706
00:50:48,597 --> 00:50:50,771
because she believes
she is right.

707
00:50:50,806 --> 00:50:54,154
And you may be right,
Miss Higgins,

708
00:50:54,189 --> 00:50:56,812
But that does not exempt
you from the laws

709
00:50:56,846 --> 00:50:58,607
of this state and this nation.

710
00:50:58,641 --> 00:51:01,713
For the two counts of
assault on a peace officer,

711
00:51:01,748 --> 00:51:04,751
I am sentencing you to
fifteen years per offense.

712
00:51:04,785 --> 00:51:06,822
For the charge of defying
a lawful order

713
00:51:06,856 --> 00:51:08,306
I am sentencing you to one year,

714
00:51:08,341 --> 00:51:10,308
for the charge of
reckless endangerment

715
00:51:10,343 --> 00:51:11,999
I am sentencing you
to 18 months,

716
00:51:12,034 --> 00:51:13,760
and for the charge of
criminal trespass,

717
00:51:13,794 --> 00:51:15,865
because you are a
habitual offender,

718
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:20,180
I am sentencing you to
the maximum of five years.

719
00:51:20,215 --> 00:51:23,632
If you are a model inmate
who treats the rules of prison

720
00:51:23,666 --> 00:51:27,049
with more respect
than you treat our laws,

721
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:30,190
you will be eligible for
parole in fourteen years.

722
00:51:30,225 --> 00:51:32,296
Bailiff, place the
inmate in custody.

723
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:33,952
Wait, what?

724
00:51:33,987 --> 00:51:36,783
I'm trying to make
the world a better place

725
00:51:36,817 --> 00:51:38,474
and you're taking my life?

726
00:51:38,509 --> 00:51:40,959
- All rise.
- You're taking away my life?

727
00:51:40,994 --> 00:51:42,375
What's happening?

728
00:51:42,409 --> 00:51:45,136
Summer, look at me.
Look at me.

729
00:51:45,171 --> 00:51:46,758
Stop crying. Okay?

730
00:51:46,793 --> 00:51:48,484
You have a new fight now.
Be ready for it.

731
00:51:48,519 --> 00:51:51,901
We're going to appeal
this in the morning.

732
00:51:51,936 --> 00:51:54,180
Sir, you can't
touch the inmate.

733
00:51:54,214 --> 00:51:56,113
It's her last fucking hug.

734
00:51:56,147 --> 00:51:57,148
Let her have it.

735
00:52:00,669 --> 00:52:03,154
Get your mind right.

736
00:52:03,189 --> 00:52:06,571
It's a long fight
and it starts now.

737
00:52:27,834 --> 00:52:29,387
God damn, Mitch.

738
00:52:29,422 --> 00:52:31,182
Who the fuck do you think you
are marching in this office?

739
00:52:31,217 --> 00:52:32,459
What in the world
was that about?

740
00:52:32,494 --> 00:52:35,635
You will knock before you
enter these chambers

741
00:52:35,669 --> 00:52:37,154
or a bailiff will
drag you out.

742
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:43,953
You think justice
was served today?

743
00:52:43,988 --> 00:52:45,955
It was harsh, but it was just.

744
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:48,648
Six months of cleaning
toilets in county jail

745
00:52:48,682 --> 00:52:50,684
is harsh, what you did
was fucking cruel.

746
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:52,755
It is a necessary
message to send.

747
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:54,136
What's the message,

748
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,518
fuck with me and I'll put you
in prison 'til

749
00:52:56,552 --> 00:52:58,382
you're too fucking old
to have children?!

750
00:52:58,416 --> 00:53:01,971
Or a goddam career?
Or any life at all?

751
00:53:02,006 --> 00:53:03,594
I followed the letter
of the law.

752
00:53:03,628 --> 00:53:05,975
For fuck's sake.

753
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:07,908
She's a woman who pushed
a full-grown man.

754
00:53:07,943 --> 00:53:09,151
The law?

755
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,257
You know...

756
00:53:11,291 --> 00:53:14,294
there is a difference between
what's legal and what's just.

757
00:53:14,329 --> 00:53:17,332
Not to me, there isn't.

758
00:53:17,366 --> 00:53:21,646
There is the law and there
is the law and that is it.

759
00:53:21,681 --> 00:53:25,443
Well,
that is the future out there.

760
00:53:25,478 --> 00:53:26,789
That is your voting base.

761
00:53:26,824 --> 00:53:28,377
And you just told them
to go fuck themselves.

762
00:53:28,412 --> 00:53:30,310
You got it backwards, John.

763
00:53:30,345 --> 00:53:32,519
That's what they're telling us.

764
00:53:35,384 --> 00:53:36,799
Give me one of those.

765
00:53:46,361 --> 00:53:48,673
We're losing this place.

766
00:53:48,708 --> 00:53:50,227
And every year
it happens faster.

767
00:53:51,435 --> 00:53:53,264
I know.

768
00:53:53,299 --> 00:53:54,610
I'm trying to stop it.

769
00:53:56,198 --> 00:53:57,924
I don't think it
can be stopped.

770
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:04,793
Here's what's going to happen.

771
00:54:04,827 --> 00:54:07,244
Charlotte's going
to appeal the sentence.

772
00:54:07,278 --> 00:54:08,762
You will suspend
the felony assaults--

773
00:54:08,797 --> 00:54:09,798
I won't.

774
00:54:09,832 --> 00:54:12,490
You made your point.

775
00:54:12,525 --> 00:54:14,837
Now show some goddam mercy.

776
00:54:14,872 --> 00:54:17,288
Suspend the felony assaults,

777
00:54:17,323 --> 00:54:21,258
reduce the trespass to a year,
you can keep all the others.

778
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:22,707
She'll be out in eight months.

779
00:54:22,742 --> 00:54:25,710
Yeah, eight months of hell.

780
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,750
So this is it, huh?

781
00:54:32,579 --> 00:54:34,063
The pound of flesh?

782
00:54:34,098 --> 00:54:36,134
It's the right thing to do.

783
00:54:36,169 --> 00:54:41,070
Right barely factors
into it anymore, John.

784
00:54:41,105 --> 00:54:44,281
The cancer of entitlement
is eating everything.

785
00:54:44,315 --> 00:54:46,352
I just snip away
at the symptom.

786
00:54:49,872 --> 00:54:52,875
Have her file
the appeal on Friday.

787
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:54,532
I don't want it
on the court record

788
00:54:54,567 --> 00:54:56,431
I changed the sentence
after one day.

789
00:54:58,156 --> 00:54:59,434
Friday it is.

790
00:55:02,506 --> 00:55:04,301
I look at my grandchildren...

791
00:55:06,164 --> 00:55:08,788
and I am terrified of the
world we are leaving them.

792
00:55:09,996 --> 00:55:11,894
I honestly have no
idea what this place

793
00:55:11,929 --> 00:55:13,896
will even look like in
a hundred years.

794
00:55:15,415 --> 00:55:17,693
Grass will cover the streets

795
00:55:17,728 --> 00:55:20,662
and weeds will
cover the rooftops.

796
00:55:20,696 --> 00:55:22,560
I don't think we make
it a hundred years.

797
00:55:23,975 --> 00:55:25,563
Then God starts over.

798
00:55:27,738 --> 00:55:31,258
Tries again,
if he's got the stomach for it.

799
00:55:43,029 --> 00:55:44,410
You have a visitor.

800
00:55:44,444 --> 00:55:45,756
I don't have an appointment.

801
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:48,103
Not an appointment.

802
00:55:50,174 --> 00:55:52,038
A visitor.

803
00:56:03,429 --> 00:56:05,362
I wanted to share
the good news.

804
00:56:08,641 --> 00:56:10,367
He made an honest woman of me.

805
00:56:19,237 --> 00:56:20,377
Congratulations.

806
00:56:22,551 --> 00:56:23,656
Thank you.

807
00:56:25,416 --> 00:56:26,383
What do you want?

808
00:56:28,592 --> 00:56:31,180
I knew it was you.

809
00:56:31,215 --> 00:56:32,975
I'm not playing
this game again.

810
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:35,115
It's not a game, Jamie.

811
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:37,255
Hey, on that fancy computer

812
00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:39,603
log onto the Bureau
of Prisons website, would you?

813
00:56:41,294 --> 00:56:44,953
You do have access to that?

814
00:56:44,987 --> 00:56:48,232
I was always
the computer whiz,

815
00:56:48,266 --> 00:56:49,302
let me have a crack at it.

816
00:56:51,235 --> 00:56:52,547
Move over.

817
00:56:52,581 --> 00:56:55,722
Get away from my--
Ow!

818
00:57:02,488 --> 00:57:04,662
I have done everything
I need to do

819
00:57:04,697 --> 00:57:06,837
to never see
this world again, Jamie.

820
00:57:06,871 --> 00:57:09,218
I am prepared.

821
00:57:09,253 --> 00:57:11,358
I will ruin my life today.

822
00:57:11,393 --> 00:57:13,326
And I swear to God
I will fucking kill you

823
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,397
so just sit down
and let me do it.

824
00:57:29,653 --> 00:57:33,346
Auto fill on the passwords?

825
00:57:34,796 --> 00:57:36,383
Good for you, Jamie.

826
00:57:36,418 --> 00:57:39,041
Way to keep the computer
system secure.

827
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:46,739
Have a look.

828
00:57:50,777 --> 00:57:53,021
If you saw him,
then you know it wasn't me.

829
00:57:53,055 --> 00:57:54,471
That's not what he said.

830
00:57:54,505 --> 00:57:55,472
Well, he's fucking lying.

831
00:57:55,506 --> 00:57:57,163
You saw him in the prison.

832
00:57:57,197 --> 00:57:58,405
I went to see him
at the prison to find out

833
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,304
if my father
was fucking involved.

834
00:58:00,338 --> 00:58:01,547
Was he?

835
00:58:05,343 --> 00:58:07,484
I had no idea. None.

836
00:58:07,518 --> 00:58:10,970
He only admitted it once I held
a fucking gun to his head.

837
00:58:11,004 --> 00:58:13,662
And when he did admit it why
didn't you blow his head off?

838
00:58:16,665 --> 00:58:18,080
He's...

839
00:58:19,357 --> 00:58:20,600
I'll tell you why.

840
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:26,192
Because deep down in here
it's what you always wanted.

841
00:58:28,608 --> 00:58:32,923
I'm sure he told you that he did
it because he loves you, right?

842
00:58:32,957 --> 00:58:36,374
He loves you, Jamie.

843
00:58:36,409 --> 00:58:40,102
And he wants the best for you,
and all the things you deserve,

844
00:58:40,137 --> 00:58:43,554
but that's just not
the truth, is it?

845
00:58:43,589 --> 00:58:46,177
He just wants what you want.

846
00:58:46,212 --> 00:58:50,112
He wants what everyone

847
00:58:50,147 --> 00:58:52,114
he wants the land.

848
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:58,327
I tell my father.

849
00:58:58,362 --> 00:59:01,296
He will call the Governor and
he will have you both arrested.

850
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:05,611
Your spineless,
woman-murdering father

851
00:59:05,645 --> 00:59:07,854
will instantly say
it was your idea.

852
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,030
You know that, right?

853
00:59:11,064 --> 00:59:16,138
He will cut an immunity deal
and he will testify against you.

854
00:59:16,173 --> 00:59:20,073
You will be charged with
attempted murder times three

855
00:59:20,108 --> 00:59:23,629
and will spend the rest
of your life in jail,

856
00:59:23,663 --> 00:59:25,182
which actually
it won't be that long

857
00:59:25,216 --> 00:59:27,149
because you will
probably commit suicide

858
00:59:27,184 --> 00:59:28,910
after your first rape.

859
00:59:33,846 --> 00:59:38,954
now this is a good one.

860
00:59:38,989 --> 00:59:41,681
I tell my husband
what your father did,

861
00:59:41,716 --> 00:59:43,338
and he will kill him.

862
00:59:49,896 --> 00:59:51,760
And then I'll tell my husband...

863
00:59:55,868 --> 00:59:59,768
that you had his child
cut from my belly

864
01:00:02,668 --> 01:00:05,981
and then you had me sterilized,

865
01:00:06,016 --> 01:00:09,260
so he can never have
a family of his own.

866
01:00:10,296 --> 01:00:14,403
And you, no matter
where you hide,

867
01:00:14,438 --> 01:00:16,336
he will find you

868
01:00:16,371 --> 01:00:19,823
and will tear you apart
with his bare fucking hands.

869
01:00:21,479 --> 01:00:24,448
Wouldn't you like to know
which option I picked?

870
01:00:28,728 --> 01:00:30,592
Beth, wait.

871
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:31,800
Beth, please.

872
01:00:31,835 --> 01:00:34,009
Please, please, please.
Please, please.

873
01:00:48,541 --> 01:00:50,060
There is a third option.

874
01:00:55,375 --> 01:00:56,445
Care to hear it?

875
01:01:16,362 --> 01:01:17,570
You're not real.

876
01:01:18,847 --> 01:01:20,953
Depends on what you
think "real" means.

877
01:01:26,303 --> 01:01:27,373
I don't know you.

878
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,790
You see what
you can understand.

879
01:01:32,447 --> 01:01:33,862
You know me.

880
01:01:45,494 --> 01:01:47,151
You're ready.

881
01:01:48,566 --> 01:01:50,189
Ready for what?

882
01:01:50,223 --> 01:01:51,742
To stand on the cliff.

883
01:01:54,883 --> 01:01:58,128
Come on.
Through the doors.

884
01:01:58,162 --> 01:01:59,577
Close them behind you

885
01:01:59,612 --> 01:02:01,407
or there's no telling
what could be waiting for you

886
01:02:01,441 --> 01:02:02,442
when you get back.

887
01:02:47,177 --> 01:02:48,454
What do you see?

888
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:53,252
Two paths.

889
01:02:53,286 --> 01:02:54,667
Look down the left one.

890
01:02:58,360 --> 01:02:59,603
Oh, God.

891
01:03:00,984 --> 01:03:02,364
Now look down the right.

892
01:03:07,473 --> 01:03:09,130
Tough choice.

893
01:03:11,063 --> 01:03:12,340
Can you help me make it?

894
01:03:14,066 --> 01:03:15,792
I can help you walk the path.

895
01:03:18,242 --> 01:03:19,485
But you must choose it.

896
01:03:42,473 --> 01:03:45,960
Let's go home.

897
01:04:25,068 --> 01:04:26,414
What did you see?

898
01:04:32,523 --> 01:04:34,111
I saw the end of us.

899
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:51,025
Come on.

900
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:08,766
Safe travels, brother.

901
01:05:08,801 --> 01:05:10,492
- See you around, Jake.
- Yes, sir.

902
01:05:11,597 --> 01:05:13,392
My pleasure meeting you.

903
01:05:13,426 --> 01:05:15,842
Just don't ever hit me
like you hit her.

904
01:05:15,877 --> 01:05:17,292
Pleasure was mine.

905
01:05:18,328 --> 01:05:19,605
- See you around, Jimmy.
- See ya.

906
01:05:22,608 --> 01:05:23,885
Now, listen, when you
get back to Texas,

907
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,404
you all start making
fucking babies,

908
01:05:25,438 --> 01:05:28,441
have yourself a hell of a life.
Okay?

909
01:05:28,476 --> 01:05:30,374
You understand a word
of what she just said?

910
01:05:30,409 --> 01:05:32,100
Something about our taxes.

911
01:05:34,965 --> 01:05:38,106
Come here.

912
01:05:43,008 --> 01:05:44,561
Actually, I'm gonna see
you Thanksgiving

913
01:05:44,595 --> 01:05:45,803
at your mom's house.

914
01:05:56,366 --> 01:05:58,333
See ya around, Walker.

915
01:05:58,368 --> 01:05:59,714
You were right
about that chili.

916
01:05:59,748 --> 01:06:01,647
No beans in that shit.

917
01:06:03,511 --> 01:06:05,271
Big old howdy to them
boy in Texas for me.

918
01:06:05,306 --> 01:06:06,514
Yes, sir.

919
01:06:06,548 --> 01:06:08,033
Ma'am.

920
01:06:19,423 --> 01:06:21,149
Come here, Jimmy.

921
01:06:26,396 --> 01:06:27,880
I want you to know
you always have a place here.

922
01:06:27,914 --> 01:06:29,537
All right?

923
01:06:29,571 --> 01:06:30,607
Thank you, sir, I do.

924
01:06:33,748 --> 01:06:35,612
Hey, I'm proud of you.

925
01:06:36,854 --> 01:06:39,374
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

926
01:06:39,409 --> 01:06:44,345
I, uh...

927
01:06:44,379 --> 01:06:46,864
Jimmy, cowboys
don't say goodbye.

928
01:06:46,899 --> 01:06:50,523
They say, "see you later," till
we're in that fucking dirt.

929
01:06:51,559 --> 01:06:52,801
We'll say our goodbyes then.

930
01:06:59,222 --> 01:07:01,707
Got a long drive.
Come on, get out of here.

931
01:07:01,741 --> 01:07:03,847
Let's go.

932
01:07:37,812 --> 01:07:39,641
I'll say this,
she is persistent.

933
01:07:44,094 --> 01:07:46,131
Hey. If you're having
second thoughts,

934
01:07:46,165 --> 01:07:47,408
you're not gonna get
a better chance

935
01:07:47,442 --> 01:07:48,443
than right now to share them.

936
01:07:48,478 --> 01:07:49,444
It's not second thoughts.

937
01:07:49,479 --> 01:07:53,069
It's... guilt maybe.

938
01:07:53,103 --> 01:07:54,967
Regret.

939
01:07:55,001 --> 01:07:56,589
I don't know what to call it.

940
01:07:56,624 --> 01:07:57,797
It's called life.

941
01:08:00,386 --> 01:08:01,629
Most of it hurts.

942
01:08:04,528 --> 01:08:06,151
But that's so when
something feels good

943
01:08:06,185 --> 01:08:07,393
we have a frame of reference.

944
01:08:55,648 --> 01:08:56,822
Where are you going?

945
01:08:58,203 --> 01:08:59,307
I don't know.

946
01:09:00,515 --> 01:09:02,828
Just wander for a bit.

947
01:09:04,933 --> 01:09:08,040
I worry about you alone, though.

948
01:09:08,074 --> 01:09:10,560
You know, those Duttons
are always gonna use

949
01:09:10,594 --> 01:09:12,251
your fear against you.

950
01:09:15,737 --> 01:09:19,465
If I can ever teach you
to be fearless...

951
01:09:24,056 --> 01:09:26,852
Then you will truly have
the world licked.

952
01:09:26,886 --> 01:09:29,234
You'll have everything
you ever wanted.

953
01:09:30,304 --> 01:09:32,409
Hell, you almost
have everything now.

954
01:09:32,444 --> 01:09:35,619
You got the second most powerful
office in the state.

955
01:09:35,654 --> 01:09:38,415
You got a child.

956
01:09:40,279 --> 01:09:43,455
And a woman who believes in you.

957
01:09:46,872 --> 01:09:48,356
And look at this.

958
01:09:49,530 --> 01:09:50,772
This is yours.

959
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:54,604
Most people...

960
01:09:54,638 --> 01:09:58,608
The best they can hope is to
dream about something like this.

961
01:09:58,642 --> 01:10:01,438
Hell, most people,
they don't even know

962
01:10:01,473 --> 01:10:03,613
something like this exists
to dream about.

963
01:10:06,961 --> 01:10:12,346
I'm 61 years old,
and these last months...

964
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:15,659
Well, they made all
the sixty years of fucking hell

965
01:10:15,694 --> 01:10:17,005
I endured worth it.

966
01:10:21,009 --> 01:10:25,359
Don't you let those
fucking Duttons deceive you

967
01:10:25,393 --> 01:10:27,844
into thinking you're a bad man.

968
01:10:29,949 --> 01:10:31,675
You're a good man, son.

969
01:10:34,782 --> 01:10:35,886
And I love you.

970
01:10:42,652 --> 01:10:44,757
I love you too, dad.

971
01:12:02,801 --> 01:12:04,009
Stop.

972
01:12:07,081 --> 01:12:08,185
Turn around.

973
01:12:15,917 --> 01:12:19,231
You should have picked
options one or two.

974
01:12:19,265 --> 01:12:22,027
Three's gonna be worse.

975
01:12:22,061 --> 01:12:24,201
Cause you're fucking mine now.

976
01:12:59,271 --> 01:13:00,376
Where have you been?

977
01:13:02,274 --> 01:13:03,724
Keeping my promise.

978
01:13:04,794 --> 01:13:06,382
Which promise is this?

979
01:13:06,416 --> 01:13:09,557
The one where I swore to
destroy anything that hurts you.

980
01:13:12,146 --> 01:13:13,285
Did you?

981
01:13:16,115 --> 01:13:17,565
Speak to me straight, Beth.

982
01:13:18,911 --> 01:13:20,499
Did I lose a son today?

983
01:13:22,536 --> 01:13:24,434
He was never your son, Dad.

984
01:13:24,469 --> 01:13:28,438
He is a disappointment
and my greatest failure

985
01:13:28,473 --> 01:13:29,474
but I...

986
01:13:31,372 --> 01:13:34,548
I raised him and I love him,
as much as I've tried not to.

987
01:13:34,582 --> 01:13:39,898
So just answer the question,
do I still have him?

988
01:13:41,071 --> 01:13:42,832
Yes.

989
01:13:42,866 --> 01:13:44,592
But now you own him, daddy.

990
01:14:00,366 --> 01:14:01,989
I'm going to sleep.

991
01:14:11,481 --> 01:14:13,379
No riding today?

992
01:14:20,179 --> 01:14:22,596
Having trouble
seeing the point today.

993
01:14:23,838 --> 01:14:25,530
There is no point.

994
01:14:25,564 --> 01:14:26,841
It's just fun.

995
01:14:27,877 --> 01:14:29,879
Rip says one day
no one will ride.

996
01:14:32,709 --> 01:14:34,090
Well...

997
01:14:37,749 --> 01:14:39,095
Guess we'd better ride.

998
01:14:40,614 --> 01:14:44,134
<i>- ♪ Put me to peace
