00:14:33,527 --> 00:14:35,736
- It's the corner office
right down here.

182
00:14:37,497 --> 00:14:40,155
This is Miss Dutton.

183
00:14:40,224 --> 00:14:41,501
- It's a pleasure to finally...

184
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:46,886
[sighs]

185
00:14:57,034 --> 00:14:58,242
[knocking]

186
00:14:58,311 --> 00:15:00,934
- All this shit has to go.

187
00:15:01,003 --> 00:15:02,418
- Ma'am?

188
00:15:02,487 --> 00:15:05,180
- I feel like I'm in my
fucking gynecologist's office.

189
00:15:05,249 --> 00:15:07,734
- I'll get the design team to--

190
00:15:07,803 --> 00:15:09,218
- Nope. I'll do it myself.

191
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:12,601
What's your name?

192
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,602
- Cal.

193
00:15:13,671 --> 00:15:15,535
- Where you from, Cal?

194
00:15:15,604 --> 00:15:18,158
Let me guess: Menlo Park.

195
00:15:18,227 --> 00:15:21,196
- Palo Alto, right next to it.
How'd you guess that?

196
00:15:21,265 --> 00:15:23,612
- I just read
the tea leaves, buddy.

197
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:28,168
- Ooh, um, there's
no smoking in the, uh...

198
00:15:30,308 --> 00:15:32,172
It's probably fine.

199
00:15:32,241 --> 00:15:34,692
- How long you been
boinking the receptionist?

200
00:15:36,245 --> 00:15:37,660
- Ma'am?

201
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:40,180
- You know how that's
gonna end, dontcha?

202
00:15:40,249 --> 00:15:43,563
So here's the thing:
I need my assistants

203
00:15:43,632 --> 00:15:47,670
to put all their efforts
into not being pussies, okay?

204
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:50,190
I do not need them chasing it.

205
00:15:50,259 --> 00:15:51,916
- You want me break up with her?

206
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:54,160
- I want you to find
another job.

207
00:15:54,229 --> 00:15:56,645
I'm 0 for three
with assistants anyway.

208
00:15:56,714 --> 00:15:59,268
Turns out working for me
is pretty fucking dangerous.

209
00:15:59,337 --> 00:16:01,995
- I'm-I'm...

210
00:16:02,064 --> 00:16:03,272
I'm not really sure
what you're asking.

211
00:16:03,341 --> 00:16:05,240
- I'm not asking
you anything, Cal.

212
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:07,794
I'm firing you.
Get the fuck out of my office.

213
00:16:07,863 --> 00:16:09,416
I'll get my own coffee.

214
00:16:11,832 --> 00:16:13,731
Hey, Cal?

215
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,422
- Yeah.
- Shut my fucking door.

216
00:16:15,491 --> 00:16:16,561
- Yep.

217
00:16:27,434 --> 00:16:28,435
- All right.

218
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,650
- [sigh]
Not looking too fired, Cal.

219
00:16:40,585 --> 00:16:42,415
- Phase one is white,

220
00:16:42,484 --> 00:16:45,314
phase two, green,

221
00:16:45,383 --> 00:16:48,490
phase three, blue,

222
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:51,424
phase four, yellow.

223
00:16:52,632 --> 00:16:54,358
Now, you'll notice in phase one,

224
00:16:54,427 --> 00:16:57,361
we lay infrastructure
for all following phases.

225
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,640
- So, you're laying in
roadways, electric, sewage

226
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:03,194
for all phases in phase one?

227
00:17:03,263 --> 00:17:06,232
- In the long term
it's much more cost effective.

228
00:17:06,301 --> 00:17:08,889
Laying infrastructure
in phases triples the cost.

229
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,822
- Kyle, this makes assumptions
about land ownership

230
00:17:10,891 --> 00:17:12,341
that we can't make.

231
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:15,620
- Uh, not the time or the place.
This is a design meeting.

232
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:18,244
- Can I see an ownership
plat over this?

233
00:17:18,313 --> 00:17:20,039
- It's not relevant
at this time.

234
00:17:20,108 --> 00:17:24,491
- Well, if you're building roads
and sewers on land

235
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,598
that you don't own, I'd say
it's pretty fucking relevant.

236
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:29,807
- Well, I guess we're going
to find out who you're
loyal to, Beth.

237
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,156
- No one mentioned this to me.

238
00:17:34,225 --> 00:17:35,813
- Beth, there are two terminals.

239
00:17:35,882 --> 00:17:38,367
That's fifty-two gates.
You saw the airport design.

240
00:17:38,436 --> 00:17:39,920
- Yes.

241
00:17:39,989 --> 00:17:42,164
- So who did you think
those gates were for?

242
00:17:42,233 --> 00:17:43,683
Hmm?

243
00:17:43,752 --> 00:17:46,789
You said it yourself,
you'd turn it into Park City.

244
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:49,999
Well, this is Park City.

245
00:17:56,351 --> 00:17:59,112

247
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:05,843

248
00:18:05,912 --> 00:18:07,879
- Ha, ha!
Ha!

249
00:18:07,948 --> 00:18:10,192
- Steer. Steer, steer!

250
00:18:10,261 --> 00:18:13,195
- Show them how it's done,
would you, Scout?

251
00:18:13,264 --> 00:18:16,164
Two of them coming,
both heifers.

252
00:18:16,233 --> 00:18:17,751
- Hey! Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

253
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,201
- Heifer, heifer, heifer!

00:18:23,516 --> 00:18:25,104
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

256
00:18:25,173 --> 00:18:26,864
Watch Mama here.

257
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:29,246
[cow lows]

258
00:18:29,315 --> 00:18:31,179
- Let's do it.
- Keep going.

259
00:18:31,248 --> 00:18:33,388
- Boss man's got steer.
Watch your coke.

260
00:18:37,254 --> 00:18:39,290
- Ha!

[shouting]

262
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:44,744
- Let's snake those
three there, huh?

263
00:18:44,813 --> 00:18:47,298
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

264
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:48,713
Hey, hey, hey!

265
00:18:51,371 --> 00:18:53,166
- I count 81.

266
00:18:53,235 --> 00:18:54,374
- That's what I got, too, sir.

267
00:18:56,411 --> 00:18:57,895
- My count's 81.

268
00:18:57,964 --> 00:19:01,140
- Yep, 81 it is.

269
00:19:01,209 --> 00:19:03,314
Get 'em to the sale, Rip.
- All right.

270
00:19:03,383 --> 00:19:05,558
- I'll start looking through
the rest of these heifers.

271
00:19:05,627 --> 00:19:06,869
- Thanks, Jack.

272
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:08,077
How are the boys?

273
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,770
- [chuckles]
They're sore as shit.

274
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:13,497
I'm gonna give them
a few days to sleep it off.

275
00:19:13,566 --> 00:19:16,396
- Man.
Guess he's done sleeping.

276
00:19:16,465 --> 00:19:17,466
- Mm-hmm.

277
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:19,710
- Where y'all need me?

278
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:20,952
- Start sorting heifers.

279
00:19:27,683 --> 00:19:28,995
- Could I have a word, sir?

280
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,656
- She talking to me?

281
00:19:34,725 --> 00:19:38,660
- I believe she said
she wants a word.

282
00:19:38,729 --> 00:19:41,421
- I can't understand a damn word
coming out of her mouth.

283
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,981
Yeah?

284
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:54,158
- Sir...

285
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,646
Whatever's between Walker
and Lloyd, it's got

286
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:01,441
nothin' to do with me.

287
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,305
Nothin' to do with
Laramie either.

288
00:20:03,374 --> 00:20:06,515
That was just their excuse.

289
00:20:06,584 --> 00:20:11,693
I was the first one up every
mornin' and the last to be done.

290
00:20:11,762 --> 00:20:13,867
Ask him.

291
00:20:13,936 --> 00:20:16,318
Ask him if anyone
works harder'n me.

292
00:20:16,387 --> 00:20:17,906
- She ain't lying, sir.

293
00:20:21,634 --> 00:20:23,567
- So fight wasn't over you, huh?

294
00:20:23,636 --> 00:20:25,500
- No, sir.

295
00:20:25,569 --> 00:20:27,571
- You just did your job.

296
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,055
- Ever' day.

297
00:20:29,124 --> 00:20:30,746
- Never fooled around
with anyone in the bunkhouse?

298
00:20:33,301 --> 00:20:35,268
- Ain't no one said I couldn't.

299
00:20:35,337 --> 00:20:36,787
- Well, common sense says
you shouldn't

300
00:20:36,856 --> 00:20:39,203
'cause the next fight
will be over you.

301
00:20:39,272 --> 00:20:42,171
- So all that "this is my home
forever" is just talk?

302
00:20:44,588 --> 00:20:46,245
Fucking scarred for life
and it don't mean nothin'?

303
00:20:51,526 --> 00:20:53,010
- You wait over
there a minute.

304
00:20:58,429 --> 00:20:59,568
When the hell did that happen?

305
00:21:01,432 --> 00:21:03,054
- The night that
we took care of that thing

306
00:21:03,123 --> 00:21:05,264
in the forest for ya.

307
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,507
- So, they all wear it.

308
00:21:07,576 --> 00:21:08,543
- Yes, sir.

309
00:21:10,545 --> 00:21:12,547
- And it just slipped your mind
to fucking mention it to me?

310
00:21:13,893 --> 00:21:15,204
- It was the night
before you got hit.

311
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,551
Before everyone got hit.

312
00:21:18,346 --> 00:21:19,312
- Does Kayce know about this?

313
00:21:19,381 --> 00:21:20,693
- Sir, it ain't his fault.

314
00:21:20,762 --> 00:21:21,970
I should've come to you
and talked to you.

315
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:23,937
- Does he know?

316
00:21:24,006 --> 00:21:25,007
- Yes, sir, he does.

317
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,325
- Jesus.

318
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:42,508
- Teeter?

319
00:21:47,513 --> 00:21:49,584
Where's your gear at?

320
00:21:49,653 --> 00:21:52,345
- Everything I own's in
the back seat of my truck.

321
00:21:52,414 --> 00:21:55,106
- Go on and grab it.
Put it back in the bunkhouse.

322
00:21:58,489 --> 00:22:01,768
- Thank you.
- Okay. All right.

323
00:22:04,046 --> 00:22:06,808
Sorry... But thank you.

324
00:22:08,879 --> 00:22:11,813
I don't know, do you
need help with... shit?

325
00:22:11,882 --> 00:22:13,539
- Teeter, just go
grab your gear.

326
00:22:16,714 --> 00:22:18,820
And hey.

327
00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:20,511
This means something.

328
00:22:21,857 --> 00:22:23,411
- Yes, sir.

329
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,033
[music]

330
00:22:51,473 --> 00:22:52,854
- [chuckles]

331
00:22:52,923 --> 00:22:55,132
Well, you have an odd
definition of retirement.

332
00:22:55,201 --> 00:22:57,272
- Yeah, well, I never
retired from this.

333
00:23:00,206 --> 00:23:01,828
When Governors
drop by unannounced,

334
00:23:01,897 --> 00:23:05,038
it's either real good or...
real bad.

335
00:23:06,315 --> 00:23:07,869
- You wanna walk with me?

336
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,492
- Oh, boy.

337
00:23:10,561 --> 00:23:12,598
Unannounced and "walk with me."

338
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:13,909
I'm in for it, aren't I?

339
00:23:14,945 --> 00:23:16,395
- [chuckles]
- [grunts]

340
00:23:22,608 --> 00:23:23,885
- You got it?

341
00:23:23,954 --> 00:23:26,232
- You know I used to just
jump over these.

342
00:23:27,682 --> 00:23:28,821
- [chuckles]

343
00:23:30,236 --> 00:23:31,548
- Oh!
- Okay.

344
00:23:31,617 --> 00:23:32,928
- Well done.
- All right.

345
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:34,965
[sighs]

346
00:23:36,656 --> 00:23:37,761
- Hit me with it.

347
00:23:40,073 --> 00:23:41,247
- I'm running for Senate.

348
00:23:45,631 --> 00:23:47,909
- [chuckles]

349
00:23:47,978 --> 00:23:50,946
I don't know, Lynelle.

350
00:23:51,015 --> 00:23:53,673
Washington is a different snake.

351
00:23:53,742 --> 00:23:55,951
- Well, I'm a politician, John.

352
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:59,092
I gotta go where I believe I can
make the biggest difference.

353
00:23:59,161 --> 00:24:01,785
There's no one in Washington
now that's doing that.

354
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,203
They've lost
the art of compromise.

355
00:24:06,272 --> 00:24:07,756
The art of negotiation.

356
00:24:08,826 --> 00:24:10,725
Those are my greatest skills.

357
00:24:10,794 --> 00:24:13,555
- Well, I can think of a few
others you're a master of.

358
00:24:13,624 --> 00:24:16,938
[laughs]

359
00:24:17,007 --> 00:24:18,457
Stewart running for
Governor, then?

360
00:24:18,526 --> 00:24:20,079
- Oh Stewart...

361
00:24:20,148 --> 00:24:21,943
Stewart's sleeping until noon
and then playing 9 holes.

362
00:24:22,012 --> 00:24:23,254
No, Stewart's done.

363
00:24:23,323 --> 00:24:25,705
I think the Governor's office
is ready

364
00:24:25,774 --> 00:24:27,500
for a new generation of leader.

365
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:29,502
I think Jamie
can take the responsibility--

366
00:24:29,571 --> 00:24:31,573
- Absolutely not.
Absolutely not.

367
00:24:31,642 --> 00:24:33,851
- He's got the name, which
we know is most important.

368
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,164
And he navigated
that Market Equities development

369
00:24:36,233 --> 00:24:38,097
with a skill that not even I
credited him with--

370
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:40,306
- Skill is not his weakness.

371
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:42,929
This is his weakness.
It's too much power.

372
00:24:42,998 --> 00:24:44,586
And it isn't his name,
it's mine.

373
00:24:46,139 --> 00:24:48,038
There's other options.
Choose one of them.

374
00:24:48,107 --> 00:24:49,936
- The other options
don't want the Montana

375
00:24:50,005 --> 00:24:51,524
that you and I do.

376
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:56,978
- Lynelle, there are things...

377
00:24:57,047 --> 00:24:59,256
there are things
about my son you do not know.

378
00:24:59,325 --> 00:25:01,948
Things that make him
unfit for your office.

379
00:25:02,017 --> 00:25:04,606
- He's the devil we know, John.

380
00:25:04,675 --> 00:25:06,746
I'll take the risk.

381
00:25:06,815 --> 00:25:08,645
I mean, unless you want to run
for governor,

382
00:25:08,714 --> 00:25:09,956
then I'll gladly endorse you.

383
00:25:10,025 --> 00:25:12,683
Listen, I just wanted
to tell you all this

384
00:25:12,752 --> 00:25:14,513
so that you weren't finding out
in the newspapers, all right?

385
00:25:18,793 --> 00:25:19,794
- Lynelle...

386
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:25,489
- I'll take it.

387
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:27,698
- Take it? Take what?

388
00:25:27,767 --> 00:25:30,839
- Your endorsement.
I'll take it.

389
00:25:30,908 --> 00:25:32,151
- You are going
to run for office

390
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,946
just so that your son
doesn't get it?

391
00:25:34,015 --> 00:25:35,499
- That's how bad he'll be
for everything you and I

392
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:38,226
worked so hard to protect.
He'll destroy it all.

393
00:25:40,918 --> 00:25:45,371
So if you want a devil
you really know, here he is.

394
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,821
- The press is gonna come
at you hard, John.

395
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:48,719
- Oh, don't I know it.

396
00:25:48,788 --> 00:25:50,065
- No, I mean, they're gonna
have a lot of questions

397
00:25:50,134 --> 00:25:51,826
about all the
things that you've done

398
00:25:51,895 --> 00:25:53,931
and you're going to have to
find a way to defend them.

399
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,312
- Not gonna defend a thing.

400
00:25:57,694 --> 00:25:59,972
"Damn right, I did it"
is gonna be my campaign slogan.

401
00:26:02,388 --> 00:26:05,322
- [laughs] Oh, geez.
Yeah, that would be your slogan.

402
00:26:05,391 --> 00:26:06,737
- Yeah.

403
00:26:10,465 --> 00:26:13,192
- I... I did not see
this one coming, John.

404
00:26:13,261 --> 00:26:15,574
- Yeah. I'm just...

405
00:26:15,643 --> 00:26:16,954
I'm just full of surprises.

406
00:26:18,956 --> 00:26:19,957
Fuck.

407
00:26:21,752 --> 00:26:23,133
Now I gotta run
for fucking Governor.

408
00:26:30,727 --> 00:26:32,349
[door opens, bell rings]

409
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:39,252
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

410
00:26:42,808 --> 00:26:43,912
- You buying or selling?

411
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,916
[music]

412
00:26:50,022 --> 00:26:51,299
- Trading.

413
00:26:51,368 --> 00:26:52,714
- Trading what?

414
00:26:56,338 --> 00:26:59,859
- One of a kind.
- Wow.

415
00:26:59,928 --> 00:27:00,998
Are you sure?

416
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,761
- Yep.

417
00:27:08,903 --> 00:27:11,388
[music]

418
00:27:15,703 --> 00:27:16,980
[sniffs]

419
00:27:19,948 --> 00:27:22,848
[clears throat]

420
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:25,920
- I'm Emily, by the way.

421
00:27:25,989 --> 00:27:27,784
- Jimmy.

422
00:27:27,853 --> 00:27:29,924
- Probably should've
introduced myself sooner.

423
00:27:29,993 --> 00:27:32,996
Masturbating stallions sort of
puts us on a first name basis.

424
00:27:34,031 --> 00:27:35,412
- At the very least.

425
00:27:36,585 --> 00:27:38,415
- So, you got a girlfriend?

426
00:27:38,484 --> 00:27:40,693
- Um...

427
00:27:40,762 --> 00:27:42,730
- Fuck, you're one
of six single guys

428
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,628
in this county under thirty.

429
00:27:44,697 --> 00:27:47,113
I dated two of them and the
other three ain't worth a shit.

430
00:27:47,182 --> 00:27:48,839
So... I thought
I'd make my move

431
00:27:48,908 --> 00:27:50,979
before you go on
and get all scooped up.

432
00:27:51,048 --> 00:27:53,119
- Well, umm...

433
00:27:53,188 --> 00:27:55,156
Aside from the wrangler
I'm paired up with

434
00:27:55,225 --> 00:27:58,159
you're the first person
I've seen in, uh...

435
00:27:58,228 --> 00:27:59,678
I actually don't know
how long I've been here.

436
00:27:59,747 --> 00:28:01,610
So... I think my chances
of getting scooped up

437
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,888
are pretty slim.

438
00:28:02,957 --> 00:28:04,855
- Let me buy you dinner.

439
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:07,409
- No, I can't let you
buy me dinner.

440
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:10,654
- You've got a girlfriend?

441
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:12,138
- I don't know.

442
00:28:12,207 --> 00:28:13,622
- Let me buy you dinner.

443
00:28:15,452 --> 00:28:17,868
- No, I can't.

444
00:28:17,937 --> 00:28:18,904
- All right.

445
00:28:20,871 --> 00:28:21,838
- But, uh...

446
00:28:23,287 --> 00:28:24,530
I can buy you dinner.

447
00:28:26,221 --> 00:28:27,326
- All right.

448
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:30,570
[music]

449
00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:32,227
[laughs]

450
00:28:45,068 --> 00:28:47,933
Crowd: Fur is murder!
Fur is murder!

451
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,074
[chanting continues]

452
00:29:18,377 --> 00:29:20,275
- Of course, you'd shop here.

453
00:29:20,344 --> 00:29:22,968
- My idea of shopping is calling
the sales manager at Gucci

454
00:29:23,037 --> 00:29:25,039
and having her fill
a box the size

455
00:29:25,108 --> 00:29:27,075
of a fucking refrigerator.

456
00:29:27,144 --> 00:29:31,493
You think you're making
a difference? Hmm?

457
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:33,875
Shaming some
plastic surgeon's wife

458
00:29:33,944 --> 00:29:36,705
out of buying a mink coat today?

459
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,086
What does that save?
Not the mink.

460
00:29:38,155 --> 00:29:39,605
Mink's already dead.

461
00:29:39,674 --> 00:29:42,159
- Not the next mink.
- Yeah, he's dead too.

462
00:29:42,228 --> 00:29:44,955
Fifteen of you standing
in front of a store

463
00:29:45,024 --> 00:29:48,096
yelling at patrons?
That isn't making a difference.

464
00:29:48,165 --> 00:29:52,929
You know, this store is the
caboose of the problem, okay?

465
00:29:52,998 --> 00:29:56,622
The engine of the problem
doesn't know you exist.

466
00:29:56,691 --> 00:29:59,452
This isn't saving
the environment, sweetheart,

467
00:29:59,521 --> 00:30:03,249
this is just inflating your ego
with very little effort.

468
00:30:03,318 --> 00:30:06,045
And when mommy and daddy
get tired of bailing you out

469
00:30:06,114 --> 00:30:09,704
and subsidizing this utter
waste of time, you'll go away.

470
00:30:09,773 --> 00:30:13,432
Meanwhile, the world
continues getting raped.

471
00:30:13,501 --> 00:30:14,813
- What the hell do you know

472
00:30:14,882 --> 00:30:17,298
about protecting
the environment?

473
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:24,512
- I know they're building
an international airport

474
00:30:24,581 --> 00:30:27,101
15 miles from the national park.

475
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:29,413
And a ski resort the size
of Crested Butte.

476
00:30:29,482 --> 00:30:31,312
And condos and hotels

477
00:30:31,381 --> 00:30:33,210
and shopping plazas
and restaurants

478
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,593
in the most fragile ecosystem
in North America.

479
00:30:36,662 --> 00:30:38,146
But you know,
you just keep protesting

480
00:30:38,215 --> 00:30:40,010
'til happy-hour, honey.

481
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:42,461
Then you can sip
your skinny margaritas

482
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:46,292
and pat yourself on the back
and you'll all get drunk enough

483
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:49,951
to stanch the stench of
the couscous-eating hippie

484
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,297
you fuck tonight.

485
00:30:51,366 --> 00:30:53,196
- Did you make that up
about the airport?

486
00:30:55,784 --> 00:30:57,131
- Give me your phone.

487
00:31:05,933 --> 00:31:10,247
This one, this is a little
above your pay grade.

488
00:31:13,837 --> 00:31:15,252
This one takes effort.

489
00:31:17,254 --> 00:31:19,843
Strategy.

490
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:22,570
Sacrifice.

491
00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:24,917
Risk, real risk,

492
00:31:24,986 --> 00:31:27,126
not that bullshit that
you pulled with my brother.

493
00:31:27,195 --> 00:31:29,094
- Why the fuck do they
need another airport?

494
00:31:29,163 --> 00:31:30,992
- They're not in the
business of need, sweetheart.

495
00:31:31,061 --> 00:31:32,407
They're in the business of want.

496
00:31:32,476 --> 00:31:33,684
And they want it because
it's going to make them

497
00:31:33,753 --> 00:31:35,755
a shit-ton of money
and they do not care

498
00:31:35,824 --> 00:31:38,241
how many animals they
have to kill to build it.

499
00:31:54,222 --> 00:31:55,914
- Good dog.

500
00:31:55,983 --> 00:31:57,950
Where'd you get him?

501
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:00,746
- He just sort of
came with the house.

502
00:32:00,815 --> 00:32:01,885
- What's his name?

503
00:32:03,749 --> 00:32:04,853
- Just been calling him "dog."

504
00:32:07,408 --> 00:32:08,788
- That's what I call mine.

505
00:32:08,857 --> 00:32:10,031
Except I say it in Lakota.

506
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:13,483
- What's dog in Lakota?

507
00:32:13,552 --> 00:32:14,898
- Sunka.

508
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:16,969
- I like that.

509
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:18,937
Mind if I call it Sunka?

510
00:32:19,006 --> 00:32:20,662
- He's your dog. You can
call him whatever you want.

511
00:32:22,216 --> 00:32:23,320
- Sunka!

512
00:32:26,116 --> 00:32:27,566
Looks like he
already knows it.

513
00:32:27,635 --> 00:32:30,086
- When you say it in their
language, they all know it.

514
00:32:35,022 --> 00:32:36,299
[music]

515
00:32:39,681 --> 00:32:40,682
[clicks tongue]

516
00:33:06,053 --> 00:33:07,675
- You can't be here.

517
00:33:07,744 --> 00:33:11,437
- I'm Livestock Commissioner.
He's tribal police.

518
00:33:11,506 --> 00:33:12,680
These horses are property

519
00:33:12,749 --> 00:33:14,647
of the Confederated Tribes
at Broken Rock.

520
00:33:14,716 --> 00:33:18,030
- These are mustangs.
We rounded them up yesterday.

521
00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:20,550
- Mustangs don't have
shoes and brands.

522
00:33:24,347 --> 00:33:27,281
- Son of a bitch.
- Yeah.

523
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,352
- We herd them with
a helicopter.

524
00:33:29,421 --> 00:33:31,768
Don't get that good a look at
them 'til we trailer 'em up.

525
00:33:31,837 --> 00:33:34,150
- Trailer them to go where?

526
00:33:34,219 --> 00:33:36,221
- Auction, I guess.

527
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:37,705
Some go to the prison.

528
00:33:37,774 --> 00:33:40,225
- These don't.
They're gonna come with us.

529
00:33:40,294 --> 00:33:41,640
- Got proof they're yours?

530
00:33:50,649 --> 00:33:52,030
Stolen you say?

531
00:33:52,099 --> 00:33:53,479
- Yeah, somebody
cut a hole in a fence,

532
00:33:53,548 --> 00:33:55,619
tried to herd 'em
with dirt bikes.

533
00:33:55,688 --> 00:33:57,138
Guess they didn't
want to be herded.

534
00:33:57,207 --> 00:33:59,968
- [laughs]
Damn right they don't.

535
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,556
Pain in the ass
getting them in here.

536
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:04,663
Took two choppers
and half a damn day.

537
00:34:04,732 --> 00:34:07,390
Look, you know how
the federal government works:

538
00:34:07,459 --> 00:34:10,186
when the wheels are in motion
they're impossible to stop.

539
00:34:10,255 --> 00:34:12,084
We're supposed
to herd them out Friday,

540
00:34:12,153 --> 00:34:15,294
but if you can get them
out before: so be it.

541
00:34:15,363 --> 00:34:16,640
But I don't know
how you're going to do it.

542
00:34:16,709 --> 00:34:18,332
You can't get a truck back here

543
00:34:18,401 --> 00:34:20,403
and you damn sure can't
do it with other horses...

544
00:34:20,472 --> 00:34:22,991
- We'll see what we can
come up with.

545
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,269
- Figure it out by Friday.

546
00:34:26,616 --> 00:34:28,963
- You got any ideas?
- I got an idea.

547
00:34:29,032 --> 00:34:31,345
- Care to share it?

548
00:34:31,414 --> 00:34:33,450
- This idea is hard to explain.

549
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:35,314
You'll just have to see it.

550
00:34:41,631 --> 00:34:42,873
[crickets]

551
00:34:45,221 --> 00:34:48,051
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
That's not how you do it.

552
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,190
Let me show ya.

553
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,782
You're just tying it
like a knot.

554
00:34:54,851 --> 00:34:57,164
So, here's what you do.

555
00:34:57,233 --> 00:34:59,131
First of all, let's get
it set up right.

556
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,514
So you're going to lay
it flat, right?

557
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:04,861
And then what you're going
to do is your going to lay

558
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:08,416
this piece goes down there,
flat, right?

559
00:35:08,485 --> 00:35:10,453
Then these come around twice.

560
00:35:10,522 --> 00:35:16,114
So you go once,
and then twice,

561
00:35:16,183 --> 00:35:18,357
And then you
pull it from here.

562
00:35:18,426 --> 00:35:20,152
And you pull it tight.

563
00:35:20,221 --> 00:35:22,810
Just like that.
Okay?

564
00:35:22,879 --> 00:35:26,434
I don't want you tying a knot
like some fucking team roper.

565
00:35:26,503 --> 00:35:28,126
Now, every piece
of your equipment:

566
00:35:28,195 --> 00:35:33,234
your saddle, your stirrups,
your cinch, your reins,

567
00:35:33,303 --> 00:35:34,649
that's the thing that's
either gonna save you

568
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:36,203
or it's gonna kill you.

569
00:35:36,272 --> 00:35:39,033
For instance,
if you dally a bull, right,

570
00:35:39,102 --> 00:35:41,760
and you break your rein
off your bridle

571
00:35:41,829 --> 00:35:45,419
it's usually because
either the leather is rotted

572
00:35:45,488 --> 00:35:47,559
or you tied a fucking
square knot... you understand?

573
00:35:47,628 --> 00:35:50,044
[phone vibrates]

574
00:35:50,113 --> 00:35:51,494
Here. I'll loosen it up.

575
00:35:51,563 --> 00:35:52,598
- Hey.

576
00:35:54,462 --> 00:35:57,258
Oh, you know, just watching
some feel-good movie on TV.

577
00:35:59,191 --> 00:36:00,434
Okay.

578
00:36:00,503 --> 00:36:03,575
- Remember to lay
this piece flat, right?

579
00:36:03,644 --> 00:36:05,680
- I gotta go up to the lodge.

580
00:36:05,749 --> 00:36:08,476
- Drive. I don't need you
getting eaten by a bear.

581
00:36:08,545 --> 00:36:10,547
- A bear knows better
than to fuck with me.

582
00:36:10,616 --> 00:36:11,755
- [laughs]

583
00:36:11,824 --> 00:36:12,825
Drive anyways.

584
00:36:14,241 --> 00:36:15,276
- Yes, sir.

585
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,765
- Beautiful.

586
00:36:21,834 --> 00:36:25,597
[music]

587
00:36:29,601 --> 00:36:31,396
[footsteps approaching]

588
00:36:39,162 --> 00:36:40,508
- Need a drink?

589
00:36:55,523 --> 00:36:56,559
You look sad.

590
00:36:56,628 --> 00:36:59,700
- Nah, I--I look lonely.

591
00:36:59,769 --> 00:37:00,804
There's a difference.

592
00:37:08,053 --> 00:37:11,505
You know, my great grandfather
didn't build this place

593
00:37:11,574 --> 00:37:13,679
with the goal
of impressing anyone.

594
00:37:15,578 --> 00:37:17,200
The goal was to...

595
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:19,064
the goal was to
just make it big enough

596
00:37:19,133 --> 00:37:22,032
that his children
never had to leave.

597
00:37:24,794 --> 00:37:26,174
But you left anyway.

598
00:37:28,763 --> 00:37:29,764
You all did...

599
00:37:33,389 --> 00:37:34,562
- Daddy, I...

600
00:37:35,736 --> 00:37:38,463
He's going to be my husband

601
00:37:38,532 --> 00:37:40,637
and my place is
sleeping beside him.

602
00:37:40,706 --> 00:37:42,950
- As it should be, honey.

603
00:37:43,019 --> 00:37:44,089
It's just I would...

604
00:37:45,849 --> 00:37:47,644
just like my family
under this roof

605
00:37:47,713 --> 00:37:50,923
and he is going
to be a part of my family.

606
00:37:54,444 --> 00:37:55,894
- You want us to move in here?

607
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:03,695
Ask him.

608
00:38:03,764 --> 00:38:05,524
- I was...

609
00:38:05,593 --> 00:38:07,008
I was hoping you'd ask him.

610
00:38:09,597 --> 00:38:11,358
- Men.

611
00:38:11,427 --> 00:38:14,015
No, Daddy. I'm afraid
you're going to take

612
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:16,949
an emotional risk
with another man.

613
00:38:17,018 --> 00:38:18,296
And I do mean ask.

614
00:38:19,711 --> 00:38:21,609
If you tell him to jump
off a fucking cliff,

615
00:38:21,678 --> 00:38:23,404
he's jumping off the cliff.
Okay?

616
00:38:23,473 --> 00:38:24,854
So you gotta ask him.

617
00:38:24,923 --> 00:38:26,165
Ask him what he would like...

618
00:38:27,753 --> 00:38:29,790
And then respect
the answer he gives.

619
00:38:32,344 --> 00:38:34,933
- Feel like I'm in [laughs]
fucking couple's therapy.

620
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,800
- If it walks like a duck
and talks like a duck...

621
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,561
- Yeah.

622
00:38:45,702 --> 00:38:46,496
- Goodnight, Daddy.

623
00:38:46,565 --> 00:38:47,566
- Yeah.

624
00:38:50,086 --> 00:38:51,915
- Governor Perry's
running for Senate.

625
00:38:55,471 --> 00:38:57,300
She offered
Jamie her endorsement.

626
00:38:58,957 --> 00:39:00,441
- [sighs]

627
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:03,237
How can such a shrewd
politician be so blind?

628
00:39:04,963 --> 00:39:07,310
- Doesn't matter.

629
00:39:07,379 --> 00:39:09,070
I convinced her to take it back.

630
00:39:10,071 --> 00:39:14,662
[music]

631
00:39:14,731 --> 00:39:16,043
- How?

632
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:21,462
- Mm.
Because she's giving it to me.

633
00:39:22,808 --> 00:39:25,052
I, uh...

634
00:39:25,121 --> 00:39:26,605
I couldn't think of
anything else to do, so--

635
00:39:28,814 --> 00:39:30,609
Honey, now--

636
00:39:30,678 --> 00:39:34,268
- Dad, now we control
the narrative.

637
00:39:34,337 --> 00:39:36,374
All right,
the first thing you do--

638
00:39:36,443 --> 00:39:37,996
- Honey.
- No, that's the second thing.

639
00:39:38,065 --> 00:39:41,379
The first thing is choosing
any of the fifty fucking things

640
00:39:41,448 --> 00:39:44,658
that Jamie has done that make
him unfit to hold public office,

641
00:39:44,727 --> 00:39:47,005
and then you remove his
fucking ass from the Capitol.

642
00:39:47,074 --> 00:39:48,972
Okay? The second thing--

643
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:50,767
- Honey. You didn't
let me finish my sentence.

644
00:39:50,836 --> 00:39:52,976
What I was saying is now
I need you to help me

645
00:39:53,045 --> 00:39:57,533
find a way out of...
out of running.

646
00:39:57,602 --> 00:39:58,568
- Not on your life.

647
00:39:58,637 --> 00:40:00,018
- No, Beth, listen to me.

648
00:40:00,087 --> 00:40:01,502
I can't spend
the next four years

649
00:40:01,571 --> 00:40:03,297
of my life in Helena.

650
00:40:03,366 --> 00:40:06,093
- The ranch won't
be here in four years, Dad.

651
00:40:06,162 --> 00:40:08,371
Listen to me, as Governor,
you will have the power

652
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,890
to withhold funds.

653
00:40:09,959 --> 00:40:12,410
You have the power
to reverse state land grants.

654
00:40:12,479 --> 00:40:14,791
You have the power to shut
that fucking airport down.

655
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:17,553
You have the power to
withhold building applications

656
00:40:17,622 --> 00:40:19,071
and tax exemptions.

657
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,695
You have the power to
withhold gambling licenses.

658
00:40:21,764 --> 00:40:24,491
You have the power to run those
fuckers out of this valley

659
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,907
and then you get to pass a law
so they can never return.

660
00:40:30,842 --> 00:40:33,016
You always tell me
that there is a way,

661
00:40:33,085 --> 00:40:36,468
another way to save
this ranch without selling.

662
00:40:36,537 --> 00:40:38,988
So this is the way.
Tell me there's another.

663
00:40:41,508 --> 00:40:42,509
This is the way.

664
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:46,789
You know that, don't you?

665
00:40:50,724 --> 00:40:52,726
- Yeah, honey.
I just...

666
00:40:52,795 --> 00:40:54,037
Just wish it wasn't.

667
00:40:56,557 --> 00:40:57,524
- Dad?

668
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:04,496
- I'm going to help you.

- That' a Yellerstone horse?

- For hell's sakes,
the last three

679
00:41:33,767 --> 00:41:35,044
have been Yellowstone horses.

680
00:41:35,113 --> 00:41:36,770
- Look, it's
not Yellerstone.

681
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:38,530
It's Yellowstone.

682
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:40,981

just take your pants off.

You can take your pants off
in the other room.

talking about that

Doesn't even make any sense.

it's a good one.

That's for sure.

693

we could bring in

them replacements heifers.

You know, the lodge

Didn't sound like
a question, did it?

728
00:45:58,997 --> 00:46:00,240
It's a question.

729
00:46:01,931 --> 00:46:03,312

00:46:03,381 --> 00:46:04,934
Um...

731
00:46:05,003 --> 00:46:06,798
I mean, are you asking us...

732
00:46:06,867 --> 00:46:08,766
To come live up there with you?
- That's what I'm asking.

733
00:46:08,835 --> 00:46:10,906
- We got that stray kid with us
sir, you don't want that.

734
00:46:10,975 --> 00:46:12,839
- Stray kids is fine.

735
00:46:12,908 --> 00:46:14,288
No stray dogs.

736
00:46:14,357 --> 00:46:16,152
- Shit, you know
I don't like dogs.

737
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:20,087

put 'em somewhere
nobody can see them,

752
00:48:57,555 --> 00:48:58,901
and point 'em at this gate.

753
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:01,455
Someone tries it again,
we'll know who it was.

754
00:49:01,524 --> 00:49:02,940
- Thank you.

755
00:49:03,009 --> 00:49:04,493
- Yeah.

756
00:49:18,058 --> 00:49:19,611
- Now we go find
who let them out.

757
00:49:20,785 --> 00:49:23,201
- Yeah. That's the plan.

758
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:25,997
- These are little victories,
in the scheme of things.

759
00:49:26,066 --> 00:49:29,000
You'd be surprised
how much they matter.

We rest the little things

Thank you.

00:49:34,695 --> 00:49:36,145
- Happy to help.

763
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:39,631
- Watch out for that one.

764
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:44,464
- Why, is she trouble?

765
00:49:44,533 --> 00:49:46,500
- [chuckles]

766
00:49:46,569 --> 00:49:49,296
When they look at you
like that they're all trouble.

767
00:50:05,071 --> 00:50:06,348
- What are you doing?

768
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:12,009
- I don't know.

769
00:50:13,941 --> 00:50:15,150
- I'm married.

770
00:50:16,841 --> 00:50:18,291
- I noticed.

772
00:50:35,308 --> 00:50:36,654
Do you believe in love
at first sight?

773
00:50:38,621 --> 00:50:42,211
- Yeah, it's how I felt about
my wife first time I saw her.

774
00:50:45,111 --> 00:50:47,009
- It's how I felt
when I first saw you.

775
00:50:49,149 --> 00:50:50,426
My fucking luck.

776
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:55,569
- Well, it can't be love.

777
00:50:57,226 --> 00:50:58,503
God wouldn't let you
love something

778
00:50:58,572 --> 00:50:59,539
that can't love you back.

779
00:51:03,163 --> 00:51:04,302
- Yeah, he would.

780
00:51:26,428 --> 00:51:28,602
[knocking]

781
00:51:28,671 --> 00:51:31,191
- Governor's asking for you
to meet her in the press room.

782
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:33,469
- Is there a press conference
scheduled for today?

783
00:51:33,538 --> 00:51:34,643
- Not scheduled.

784
00:51:36,921 --> 00:51:38,336

787
00:52:03,085 --> 00:52:04,190
- Join us, Jamie.

788
00:52:17,203 --> 00:52:20,309
- Thanks for the flowers.
Meant a whole lot.

789
00:52:20,378 --> 00:52:23,036
- I'm...
I'm surprised you're here.

790
00:52:23,105 --> 00:52:26,350
- We, uh... we wouldn't miss
this for the world.

791
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,571
- Well, as many of you
may have suspected,

792
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,883
I believe that
I can best represent Montana

793
00:52:42,952 --> 00:52:44,989
from the Senate.

794
00:52:45,058 --> 00:52:48,372
The next Governor of
Montana must hold steadfast

795
00:52:48,441 --> 00:52:49,856
to the progress that
we have made,

796
00:52:49,925 --> 00:52:54,067
and yet, never allow
that progress to redefine

797
00:52:54,136 --> 00:52:56,656
what it means
to be a Montanan.

798
00:52:56,725 --> 00:53:00,073
It is my great honor
to introduce you

799
00:53:00,142 --> 00:53:03,110
to my choice as the next
Governor of Montana:

800
00:53:05,492 --> 00:53:06,597
John Dutton.

801
00:53:18,436 --> 00:53:20,300
- John.
- Thank you, Governor.

802
00:53:20,369 --> 00:53:21,991
- [chuckles]

803
00:53:33,417 --> 00:53:35,281
- You don't see it
on your way to work,

804
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:38,939
in the fields,
or on the mountain.

805
00:53:39,008 --> 00:53:41,804
But there's a war being
waged against our way of life.

806
00:53:41,873 --> 00:53:44,669
They'll tell you all the reasons
why our way of life...

807
00:53:44,738 --> 00:53:46,913
- This is just the beginning.

808
00:53:46,982 --> 00:53:49,226
John: ...are bad
for this country,

809
00:53:49,295 --> 00:53:50,468
bad for our future.

810
00:53:51,918 --> 00:53:54,369
How it's immoral
that you live here,

811
00:53:54,438 --> 00:53:57,579
work here,
grow their food here.

812
00:53:57,648 --> 00:53:59,650
They will tell it so much
you might even start

813
00:53:59,719 --> 00:54:00,754
to believe it yourself.

814
00:54:01,859 --> 00:54:04,827
Question what you do
and who you are.

815
00:54:04,896 --> 00:54:08,693
They'll tell you that
the land's only hope

816
00:54:08,762 --> 00:54:12,249
is for them to
be its steward.

817
00:54:12,318 --> 00:54:15,113
The ugly truth is
they want the land,

818
00:54:15,182 --> 00:54:17,254
and if they get it,

819
00:54:17,323 --> 00:54:20,153
it will never look
like our land again.

820
00:54:20,222 --> 00:54:22,673
That is progress
in today's terms,

821
00:54:22,742 --> 00:54:27,091
so if it's progress you seek,
do not vote for me.

822
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:30,612
I am the opposite of progress.

823
00:54:30,681 --> 00:54:32,614
I am the wall
that it bashes against,

824
00:54:32,683 --> 00:54:34,409
and I will not be
the one who breaks.
