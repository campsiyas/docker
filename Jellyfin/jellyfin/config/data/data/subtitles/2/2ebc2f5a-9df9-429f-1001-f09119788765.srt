00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:21,859
while you choose a spot
for your father.

187
00:18:21,928 --> 00:18:23,619
I'll leave you a beef.

188
00:18:23,688 --> 00:18:25,380
Your family can graze, too.

189
00:18:25,449 --> 00:18:27,002
- Thank you.

190
00:18:28,969 --> 00:18:32,041
- Boys, let's push these cattle
out of here.

191
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,491
Cut out a steer for 'em,
all right?

192
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,254
- I'm sorry for you
being punished.

193
00:18:38,772 --> 00:18:39,911
- We are, too.

194
00:18:41,327 --> 00:18:42,742
- Come on.

195
00:18:48,023 --> 00:18:51,647
- Ya!

196
00:18:55,824 --> 00:18:56,894
Ya.

197
00:18:58,551 --> 00:19:00,553
[kiss]

198
00:19:00,622 --> 00:19:01,830
Let's go, boys.

199
00:19:06,973 --> 00:19:08,630
[gunshot]

200
00:19:18,295 --> 00:19:19,434
Let's go, boys.

201
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:24,922
[clicks tongue]

202
00:19:24,991 --> 00:19:28,374
[beeping]

203
00:19:28,443 --> 00:19:30,790
- That's a disconnect code.

204
00:19:30,859 --> 00:19:32,481
- Dietician's in there?

205
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,517
- No one's in there.

206
00:19:35,829 --> 00:19:36,830
- Oh my God.

207
00:19:36,899 --> 00:19:39,212
Oh my God, no.

208
00:19:43,251 --> 00:19:45,770
- What is today?

209
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,739
- Thursday.

210
00:19:48,808 --> 00:19:50,154
- The month.

211
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:51,673
- August.

212
00:19:51,742 --> 00:19:53,295
- You need to lay down.

213
00:19:53,364 --> 00:19:54,538
- Been laying down long enough.

214
00:19:54,607 --> 00:19:55,987
- <i>We have a code three.
422 I.C.U.</i>

215
00:19:56,056 --> 00:19:57,644
- What's a code three?
- You are.

216
00:19:57,713 --> 00:19:59,198
- I'm not asking.

217
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:03,512
- Daddy.

218
00:20:07,136 --> 00:20:09,277
[grunts]

219
00:20:09,346 --> 00:20:10,795
- What happened to you?

220
00:20:13,073 --> 00:20:14,627
- Same thing that
happened to you.

221
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:19,597
- Who else did it happen to?

222
00:20:20,771 --> 00:20:22,290
- Happened to all of us.

223
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:23,291
- Mr. Dutton, we need to get
you back to bed.

224
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,706
- Who did we lose?

225
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:27,536
- Define lose, Daddy.
- Who did we lose?

226
00:20:27,605 --> 00:20:28,813
- Get me some Persantine.

227
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:34,888
- All right, Mr. Dutton,
we're going to sit you down.

228
00:20:34,957 --> 00:20:37,408
Can I see your right hand?

229
00:20:37,477 --> 00:20:39,272
Got to put this
back in, okay?

230
00:20:45,174 --> 00:20:47,418
Mr. Dutton, count back from
a hundred for me, okay?

231
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,592
- What?
- 99.

232
00:20:48,661 --> 00:20:50,525
- What are you doing?
No, Dad. No!

233
00:20:50,594 --> 00:20:51,560
What are you doing?

234
00:20:51,629 --> 00:20:53,493
You tell me he'll never wake up

235
00:20:53,562 --> 00:20:55,426
and when he does you put
him back to fucking sleep?

236
00:20:55,495 --> 00:20:56,600
- If he has a blood clot,
and I can promise you he does,

237
00:20:56,669 --> 00:20:58,049
- Get your fucking hands off me!

238
00:20:58,118 --> 00:20:59,810
- Movement can dislodge
it and send it into his heart

239
00:20:59,879 --> 00:21:01,432
and then he woke up for nothing.
Let me do my--

240
00:21:01,501 --> 00:21:03,883
- Daddy!
- Let me do my job.

241
00:21:03,952 --> 00:21:06,195
Keep her out here
until I say otherwise.

242
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:10,683
[music]

243
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,326
- What happened to your face?

244
00:21:35,397 --> 00:21:37,641
- What happened to yours,
you insensitive little fuck?

245
00:21:38,987 --> 00:21:40,609
- Nothing happened to mine.

246
00:21:40,678 --> 00:21:42,784
- Yeah?
You should go find a mirror.

247
00:21:46,788 --> 00:21:47,823
- My dad's dying.

248
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,757
- So is mine.

249
00:21:52,552 --> 00:21:55,106
- What's killing yours?

250
00:21:55,175 --> 00:21:56,176
- Heroin.

251
00:21:57,937 --> 00:21:58,972
What's killing yours?

252
00:22:00,388 --> 00:22:02,321
- The Twenty-first century.

253
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:06,152
- You mean like... time?

254
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:11,985
- Yeah, something like that.

255
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:13,918
- How does time kill?

256
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:22,202
- With my family it sort of
takes the kitchen sink approach.

257
00:22:23,928 --> 00:22:25,723
- Don't know what that means.

258
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,138
- You need to study harder
in school, kid.

259
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,383
- I dropped out of school.

260
00:22:32,178 --> 00:22:33,628
- Why'd you do that?

261
00:22:34,663 --> 00:22:36,562
- Cause... Fuck it.

262
00:22:38,736 --> 00:22:40,359
- That's a winning attitude.

263
00:22:42,084 --> 00:22:43,327
Well, you know what they say:

264
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:45,191
the world needs
ditch diggers, too.

265
00:22:47,987 --> 00:22:49,333
- You got another one of those?

266
00:23:12,218 --> 00:23:13,322
You're pretty cool.

267
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:17,775
- Let's be honest, you're
probably going to be in jail

268
00:23:17,844 --> 00:23:20,744
in a few years.
What's a cigarette gonna hurt?

269
00:23:20,813 --> 00:23:22,262
- Why do you say that?

270
00:23:22,331 --> 00:23:23,402
- Because your
life is a mess

271
00:23:23,471 --> 00:23:25,024
and you're perfectly
fine with it

272
00:23:25,093 --> 00:23:28,130
because you've had
no one to admire.

273
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:30,305
No one to set an example.

274
00:23:30,374 --> 00:23:34,482
Now you're a lazy piece
of shit, right?

275
00:23:34,551 --> 00:23:37,346
But you're handsomish
and charming

276
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,314
and smart enough
to bullshit your way

277
00:23:39,383 --> 00:23:41,178
out of any trouble
you get into.

278
00:23:41,247 --> 00:23:43,594
But one day you are gonna find
yourself some trouble

279
00:23:43,663 --> 00:23:45,665
that you can't bullshit
your way out of.

280
00:23:47,943 --> 00:23:49,393
- You a therapist?

281
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:56,227
- I am the rock therapists
break themselves against.

282
00:23:57,781 --> 00:23:59,058
- You're pretty good at it.

283
00:24:00,646 --> 00:24:03,027
- Well, you're pretty
easy to analyze.

284
00:24:03,096 --> 00:24:05,513
I used to love guys like
you in high school.

285
00:24:05,582 --> 00:24:07,894
Give me a troubled loser
with blue eyes

286
00:24:07,963 --> 00:24:10,518
and I'd dry hump a hole
in his jeans.

287
00:24:10,587 --> 00:24:11,933
- What's dry hump?

288
00:24:14,522 --> 00:24:16,765
- How old are you?

289
00:24:16,834 --> 00:24:17,904
- 14.

290
00:24:17,973 --> 00:24:19,906
- Give me that
fucking cigarette.

291
00:24:20,942 --> 00:24:22,115
- The fuck?

292
00:24:24,877 --> 00:24:27,673
- Jesus, I thought you were 17.

293
00:24:27,742 --> 00:24:30,227
- You need to come inside.

294
00:24:30,296 --> 00:24:31,780
- Am I in trouble?

295
00:24:31,849 --> 00:24:33,748
- No, you're not in trouble.

296
00:24:35,577 --> 00:24:36,820
Are you a friend of the family?

297
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:42,826
- I guess I am now.

298
00:24:44,172 --> 00:24:45,725
- You should come, too.

299
00:24:50,454 --> 00:24:52,352
- Shit.

300
00:24:52,421 --> 00:24:53,699
- Yeah.

301
00:25:15,962 --> 00:25:19,552
- So when these lines
move vertically,

302
00:25:19,621 --> 00:25:23,418
it's reading the electrical
impulses of the brain.

303
00:25:23,487 --> 00:25:26,766
And when they level
in this manner here,

304
00:25:26,835 --> 00:25:28,147
it is displaying a--

305
00:25:28,216 --> 00:25:29,597
- Just tell him, dude.

306
00:25:33,117 --> 00:25:35,119
- Well, there's no
brain activity.

307
00:25:35,188 --> 00:25:37,812
The only thing keeping your
father alive is the machine.

308
00:25:40,228 --> 00:25:41,401
- What does that mean?

309
00:25:43,265 --> 00:25:44,957
- Well, the lack of brain
activity would suggest--

310
00:25:45,026 --> 00:25:47,442
- It means he's gone, honey.

311
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,723
Can he have some time
to say goodbye?

312
00:25:52,792 --> 00:25:54,069
- There's a protocol
we should discuss--

313
00:25:54,138 --> 00:25:55,174
- Yeah, no.
Not today there isn't.

314
00:25:55,243 --> 00:25:56,520
Get the fuck out.

315
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:58,798
Get the fuck out
so he can say goodbye.

316
00:26:03,216 --> 00:26:06,392
[air pumping]

317
00:26:15,332 --> 00:26:17,127
- [sniffs]

318
00:26:20,855 --> 00:26:21,994
Don't know what to say.

319
00:26:24,962 --> 00:26:27,033
- Say whatever you feel.

320
00:26:28,069 --> 00:26:29,518
That's what you say.

321
00:26:34,454 --> 00:26:36,456
- [sniffs]

322
00:26:36,525 --> 00:26:37,734
Fuck you.

323
00:26:39,459 --> 00:26:43,084
Fuck you for leaving
me in this place

324
00:26:43,153 --> 00:26:45,742
with nothing and nobody.

325
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,850
If there's a hell,
you're in it

326
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:55,061
And I'll see you
when I get there.

327
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,791
Son of a bitch.

328
00:27:02,828 --> 00:27:07,764
[music]

329
00:27:11,837 --> 00:27:13,217
- That was a good speech.

330
00:27:16,186 --> 00:27:17,359
I like your style.

331
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,776
- I don't have a style.

332
00:27:22,157 --> 00:27:23,331
- Yeah, you do.

333
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:42,557
[beeps and buzzing]

334
00:27:44,214 --> 00:27:50,496
[background chatter]

335
00:27:55,052 --> 00:27:56,019
- Hit me.

336
00:27:56,088 --> 00:27:57,054
Come on now.

337
00:27:59,229 --> 00:28:01,818
Come on, come on now, baby.
Woo hoo!

338
00:28:01,887 --> 00:28:03,026
- Blackjack.

339
00:28:04,579 --> 00:28:06,063
- Come to papa.

340
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,722
Mm! There you go.

341
00:28:09,791 --> 00:28:12,173
- Big spender.

342
00:28:12,242 --> 00:28:13,795
- You're welcome.

343
00:28:16,073 --> 00:28:17,040
Hey.

344
00:28:18,351 --> 00:28:21,147
Hey.

345
00:28:21,216 --> 00:28:24,461
I tip you every time I win
and all I been doing is winning.

346
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:27,119
The least you can say
is thank you.

347
00:28:27,188 --> 00:28:28,707
- Thank you.

348
00:28:28,776 --> 00:28:30,225
- You're welcome.

349
00:28:34,402 --> 00:28:37,439
Ungrateful motherfuckers, man.

350
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:40,166
We give you casinos,
free college,

351
00:28:40,235 --> 00:28:42,755
free fucking medical care.

352
00:28:42,824 --> 00:28:44,412
Don't know what
else you people want.

353
00:28:44,481 --> 00:28:47,864
- Gee, I don't know...
Maybe our land back?

354
00:28:47,933 --> 00:28:51,799
Think you can MacGyver
that up for us, Wasichu?

355
00:28:51,868 --> 00:28:53,076
- What's that mean?

356
00:28:53,145 --> 00:28:54,318
- Ain't a compliment.

357
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,357
- You fucking people.

358
00:28:58,426 --> 00:29:00,669
Take, take, take, take,
take, take, take.

359
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,085
Hey.

360
00:29:02,154 --> 00:29:03,293
I've done more to
get your land back

361
00:29:03,362 --> 00:29:04,881
than anybody in
the past century.

362
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,986
- We don't have our land back.
John Dutton has our land.

363
00:29:07,055 --> 00:29:08,470
- Yeah, and where's he at?

364
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:11,232
Rotting in a fucking bed,
waiting to die.

365
00:29:11,301 --> 00:29:13,786
So, you know.
You're welcome.

366
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,377
- Are you saying
you shot John Dutton?

367
00:29:18,446 --> 00:29:19,827
- I'm just a
party planner, baby.

368
00:29:19,896 --> 00:29:21,311
I just put people together.

369
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,831
What they do
is what they do...

370
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,730
And what they did
was clear your land.

371
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,283
You want it back?

372
00:29:28,352 --> 00:29:32,046
Stop your bitching, deal me
cards or go fucking get it.

373
00:29:32,115 --> 00:29:34,427
[music]

374
00:29:47,889 --> 00:29:49,373
Woo!
[tapping on table]

375
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:51,306
[giggles]

376
00:29:52,652 --> 00:29:53,861
Meter maid?

377
00:29:54,931 --> 00:29:56,277
- Excuse me, sir.

378
00:29:56,346 --> 00:29:57,899
Could we speak to
you for a moment?

379
00:30:03,422 --> 00:30:04,561
- Speak.

380
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:08,876
You gonna speak, fucking spea--

381
00:30:08,945 --> 00:30:10,084
[gasps]

382
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:14,536
[coughing, gagging]

383
00:30:16,021 --> 00:30:17,401
- Sorry for the intrusion.

384
00:30:25,685 --> 00:30:26,963
- So who is he?

385
00:30:27,032 --> 00:30:28,447
- His name is Chester Spears.

386
00:30:28,516 --> 00:30:30,242
Dishonorable discharge
from the Army

387
00:30:30,311 --> 00:30:33,176
in 2006 for conduct unbecoming.

388
00:30:33,245 --> 00:30:35,419
Did three years in
Rock Springs for robbery.

389
00:30:35,488 --> 00:30:39,113
Another five years in Red Lodge
for aggravated assault.

390
00:30:39,182 --> 00:30:41,184
Has arrests for check fraud,

391
00:30:41,253 --> 00:30:44,532
wire fraud,
two DUI convictions.

392
00:30:44,601 --> 00:30:46,603
- TheGreat White Hopeless.

393
00:30:46,672 --> 00:30:49,295
Why am I looking at him?

394
00:30:49,364 --> 00:30:50,987
- He said he knows
who hit the Duttons.

395
00:30:51,056 --> 00:30:52,678
Bragged about
putting it together.

396
00:30:54,162 --> 00:30:55,508
[chuckles]

397
00:30:55,577 --> 00:30:58,753
- Putting it together?

398
00:30:58,822 --> 00:31:01,480
Ask him if he knows
who killed Kennedy.

399
00:31:01,549 --> 00:31:03,102
Probably tell you
he planned that, too.

400
00:31:05,346 --> 00:31:07,831
He's a drug dealer, Mo.
At best.

401
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,213
- Drug dealers don't
gamble wads like this.

402
00:31:10,282 --> 00:31:11,697
Can't afford to lose it.

403
00:31:12,698 --> 00:31:14,527
- He didn't win that?

404
00:31:14,596 --> 00:31:17,116
- These are his winnings.

405
00:31:23,364 --> 00:31:26,574
- See if you can help him
separate fantasy from reality.

406
00:31:28,403 --> 00:31:31,717
- How much pressure
before we let him cry uncle?

407
00:31:31,786 --> 00:31:33,443
- What they did
to John Dutton

408
00:31:33,512 --> 00:31:37,033
hasn't been done since
they did it to us.

409
00:31:37,102 --> 00:31:40,174
We need to know who's
trying to take his land

410
00:31:40,243 --> 00:31:42,176
because they're coming
after ours next.

411
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,662
No uncles for that one.

412
00:31:46,766 --> 00:31:47,906
- Okay.

413
00:31:50,115 --> 00:31:53,739
- But tradition,
I won't abandon.

414
00:31:55,085 --> 00:31:57,777
Do it the way we used to do it.

415
00:31:57,846 --> 00:32:00,470
Do it the way our grandfathers
did it.

416
00:32:02,058 --> 00:32:07,270
[music]

417
00:32:09,444 --> 00:32:11,515
- Motherfucker!
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

418
00:32:11,584 --> 00:32:12,896
I know your face!

419
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:14,208
I know your fucking face!

420
00:32:14,277 --> 00:32:15,416
You can't fucking do this!

421
00:32:15,485 --> 00:32:16,831
- Why not?

422
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,902
You've been doing it to us
for five hundred years.

423
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:20,559
- Then kill me, motherfucker!

424
00:32:20,628 --> 00:32:22,285
Go on and kill me, then!

425
00:32:22,354 --> 00:32:24,735
Spend the rest of your
fucking life in a prison cell

426
00:32:24,804 --> 00:32:27,600
until they shoot bleach
in your veins

427
00:32:27,669 --> 00:32:30,431
and you piss yourself on
your way to fucking hell!

428
00:32:34,883 --> 00:32:37,714
- My mother was killed
by two white men

429
00:32:37,783 --> 00:32:41,166
who offered her a ride
when her car ran out of gas.

430
00:32:41,235 --> 00:32:43,651
I sat strapped
in a car seat for three days

431
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,791
before someone found me.

432
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,173
Hell is all I've ever known.

433
00:32:52,901 --> 00:32:54,386
- What are you doing?

434
00:32:54,455 --> 00:32:55,697
What are you fucking doing?

435
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:56,940
We can talk about it.

436
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:58,252
[screaming]

437
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,646
[groans]

438
00:33:18,513 --> 00:33:19,859
- So, you're the party planner.

439
00:33:21,482 --> 00:33:23,656
Tell me about this party
you planned for John Dutton.

440
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:29,179
- I'm hurt here, man.
You really hurt--

441
00:33:29,248 --> 00:33:30,767
- Now you're hurt.

442
00:33:32,631 --> 00:33:34,633
Tell me about this party.

443
00:33:34,702 --> 00:33:37,567
Who wanted you to plan it?
[spits]

444
00:33:37,636 --> 00:33:39,500
- If I tell you I'm a dead man.

445
00:33:39,569 --> 00:33:41,053
- You're already a dead man.

446
00:33:41,122 --> 00:33:43,193
Only question is how.

447
00:33:46,196 --> 00:33:47,232
[crying]

448
00:33:47,301 --> 00:33:49,130
- I don't wanna
fucking die, man.

449
00:33:49,199 --> 00:33:50,649
I don't wanna fucking die.

450
00:33:50,718 --> 00:33:51,960
- You a father?

451
00:33:53,548 --> 00:33:54,825
Love them?

452
00:33:59,899 --> 00:34:02,178
We're at war, you and me.

453
00:34:02,247 --> 00:34:05,767
When you die, I take the war
to your family.

454
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:08,908
Stop thinking about yourself.

455
00:34:08,977 --> 00:34:10,945
Think about your family,

456
00:34:11,014 --> 00:34:13,051
and tell me something
that will save them.

457
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:21,576
- [grunts]

458
00:34:27,168 --> 00:34:32,104
[music]

459
00:34:35,003 --> 00:34:36,729
- Lloyd!

460
00:34:45,048 --> 00:34:47,292
Take Jake and Ethan
and head out to pasture nine.

461
00:34:47,361 --> 00:34:49,742
Start moving them heifers.

462
00:34:49,811 --> 00:34:52,366
- Three guys and
you're going to take seven

463
00:34:52,435 --> 00:34:53,643
to doctor these few cows.

464
00:34:53,712 --> 00:34:55,127
- Lloyd, the boss
is coming home today,

465
00:34:55,196 --> 00:34:56,301
and I want people around.

466
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:58,682
You keep that between you and I.
Go on.

467
00:34:58,751 --> 00:35:01,444
- Jake, Ethan, you're with me.
Come on.

468
00:35:06,138 --> 00:35:07,174
- All right, come on.

469
00:35:07,243 --> 00:35:09,176
Colby, Teeter, Walker, let's go.

470
00:35:15,527 --> 00:35:16,666
Nurse: Back

471
00:35:18,392 --> 00:35:19,496
There you go.

472
00:35:22,499 --> 00:35:25,468
John: I can do--
I can do this myself.

473
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,439
Didn't think I was going
to make it, did you?

474
00:35:31,508 --> 00:35:33,579
- Never doubted it for a second.

475
00:35:33,648 --> 00:35:35,857
- Yeah. Liar.

476
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:37,480
- Everyone else doubted.

477
00:35:37,549 --> 00:35:39,413
Not me. Not once.

478
00:35:41,863 --> 00:35:43,934
- I can...

479
00:35:44,003 --> 00:35:46,074
- We need you to lay down.

480
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,179
- I know the drill.

481
00:35:49,768 --> 00:35:51,218
[grunts]

482
00:35:51,287 --> 00:35:53,012

483
00:36:01,297 --> 00:36:05,611
[music]

484
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,681
Yeah.

485
00:36:17,451 --> 00:36:20,764
How's the ranch?

486
00:36:20,833 --> 00:36:23,388
- We'll talk about the ranch
when we get there.

487
00:36:27,115 --> 00:36:30,015
- Good. Okay, let's try
the other side.

488
00:36:34,157 --> 00:36:35,193
- Stop.

489
00:36:37,229 --> 00:36:38,817
Back up.

490
00:36:45,617 --> 00:36:46,894
- Great.

491
00:36:47,929 --> 00:36:49,483
Oh, it's almost massage time.

492
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,555
Then a bath.

493
00:36:53,935 --> 00:36:55,282
- What happened to him?

494
00:36:55,351 --> 00:36:57,732
Intercom: <i>Dr. Plunkett,
Dr. Plunkett.</i>

495
00:36:57,801 --> 00:37:01,184
- It's on the list of things
we need to discuss.

496
00:37:01,253 --> 00:37:02,289
- A list of things.

497
00:37:02,358 --> 00:37:04,808
- A long list, Daddy.

498
00:37:04,877 --> 00:37:06,258
Come on.

499
00:37:07,155 --> 00:37:11,574
[music]

500
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,479
- All this for us?

501
00:37:20,548 --> 00:37:22,343
- I'll see you at the house.

502
00:37:22,412 --> 00:37:23,379
- All right, you don't
want to ride

503
00:37:23,448 --> 00:37:24,621
in this piece of shit anyway.

504
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:26,830
Can we turn these
flashing lights off?

505
00:37:26,899 --> 00:37:28,832
Hey.

506
00:37:28,901 --> 00:37:29,902
Hey...

507
00:37:31,145 --> 00:37:33,043
All right, come here.

508
00:37:33,112 --> 00:37:36,150
[music]

509
00:37:53,512 --> 00:37:55,514
- He's coming in!

510
00:38:48,395 --> 00:38:50,914
- One, two, three.

511
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:07,241
- All right, I can walk
from here.

512
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:09,139
Ow, God damn it.

513
00:39:09,208 --> 00:39:11,245
- Put him down.

514
00:39:11,314 --> 00:39:13,765
- I didn't get shot in my damn
legs, for hell's sake...

515
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,423
Okay.

516
00:39:16,492 --> 00:39:18,148
Now what you going
to do, smarty?

517
00:39:18,217 --> 00:39:19,460
- Two, three.

-[grunts]

519
00:39:22,221 --> 00:39:24,569
This is more fucking
dangerous than walking.

520
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,715
No.
No, no.

521
00:39:32,784 --> 00:39:34,441
- Dad, you wanted to come home,

522
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,546
this is what they
required to release you.

523
00:39:36,615 --> 00:39:38,306
- I'm released now, all right?

524
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,860
Their requirements,
they don't matter.

525
00:39:39,929 --> 00:39:41,689
Get all this shit out of here.

526
00:39:41,758 --> 00:39:42,725
- Sir, we're required
to provide you

527
00:39:42,794 --> 00:39:43,829
with the same standard of care

528
00:39:43,898 --> 00:39:46,004
that you received
in the hospital.

529
00:39:46,073 --> 00:39:48,386
- Beth, get all this
shit out of here.

530
00:39:48,455 --> 00:39:49,801
I...

Oh, God, no.
Let me do it.

[grunts]

534
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:06,162
- He's got it.

535
00:40:06,231 --> 00:40:07,197
- There. You comfortable?

536
00:40:07,266 --> 00:40:09,717
- No.

537
00:40:09,786 --> 00:40:12,720
- Okay, he is all yours.
Have fun.

538
00:40:14,964 --> 00:40:17,622
- I'm Maggie.
I'm here to take care of you.

You need anything,
just give that a little press.

540
00:40:23,628 --> 00:40:25,319
Okay, we'll have lunch
in a couple hours

541
00:40:25,388 --> 00:40:27,321
and then we'll get you bathed,
how does that sound?

542
00:40:33,603 --> 00:40:35,225
- Just get some rest.
- Mm-hmm.

543
00:40:37,089 --> 00:40:38,090
- Please.

00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,475
- [sighs]

546
00:40:53,416 --> 00:40:55,625
[machine whirring]

547
00:40:59,802 --> 00:41:01,217
[groaning]

548
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,339
Maggie: Oh, Mister Dutton!
No, no, no.

549
00:41:20,408 --> 00:41:21,824
No, go back to your room.

550
00:41:23,101 --> 00:41:24,551
-[laughs]

551
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,897
Maggie...

552
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:28,831
You're fired.

553
00:41:31,696 --> 00:41:35,147
[wind chimes]

554
00:41:43,362 --> 00:41:44,571
- I think you should
stay in the lodge

555
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,504
until I figure this thing out.

556
00:41:50,231 --> 00:41:54,995
- We've, uh... moved
into the Foreman's house.

557
00:41:55,064 --> 00:41:58,343
- Good. Good.
Cabin's too remote.

558
00:42:05,557 --> 00:42:06,731
- Cabin's gone, Daddy.

559
00:42:09,147 --> 00:42:10,873
They decided to kill that, too.

560
00:42:14,566 --> 00:42:16,085
- What...

561
00:42:16,154 --> 00:42:17,086
[grunts]

562
00:42:17,155 --> 00:42:18,708
What else...

563
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:22,712
What else did
they decide to kill?

564
00:42:25,059 --> 00:42:26,095
- You're home.

565
00:42:27,924 --> 00:42:31,134
I'd like to end
this day on a victory.

566
00:42:31,203 --> 00:42:33,171
We'll talk defeat tomorrow.

567
00:42:36,001 --> 00:42:46,633
[music]

568
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,590
- What are you hunting?

569
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,766
- Whatever's hunting us.

570
00:43:20,528 --> 00:43:22,461
- No one will talk to me.

571
00:43:24,187 --> 00:43:25,879
Nobody will tell me
what happened.

572
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:28,985
- I don't have the heart.

573
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,407
They came after all of us.

574
00:43:39,547 --> 00:43:40,583
But we beat them.

575
00:43:42,309 --> 00:43:43,310
- All of them?

576
00:43:45,484 --> 00:43:46,589
- Every one they sent.

577
00:43:50,144 --> 00:43:53,423
- Well, you haven't got anything
until you get the sender, son.

578
00:43:53,492 --> 00:43:55,667
- Yeah.
Don't know the sender.

579
00:43:57,462 --> 00:43:59,084
- That's what
we figure out next.

580
00:43:59,153 --> 00:44:00,465
- Yeah.

581
00:44:02,674 --> 00:44:04,918
[wind chimes sounding]

582
00:44:14,444 --> 00:44:15,929
[sniffs]

583
00:44:15,998 --> 00:44:17,585
Goddamn, why does it feel like
the whole

584
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,001
fucking ranch is on fire?

585
00:44:20,761 --> 00:44:22,314
- Burning brush piles.

586
00:44:22,383 --> 00:44:24,144
- Why are we
burning brush piles?

587
00:44:27,492 --> 00:44:28,666
- We ain't burning them, Dad.

588
00:44:44,233 --> 00:44:45,924
[bird song]

589
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,586
- Smart bird.

590
00:44:58,488 --> 00:45:00,836
- It's not an annexation issue,
it's a formation issue,

591
00:45:00,905 --> 00:45:04,494
and it's really a county
issue at this point, so...

592
00:45:04,563 --> 00:45:06,600
I would wait until
the development is built.

593
00:45:06,669 --> 00:45:09,120
Why incur the
added regulations?

594
00:45:09,189 --> 00:45:10,328
Uh-huh.

595
00:45:12,813 --> 00:45:14,608
Roarke, I'll have
to call you back.

596
00:45:17,438 --> 00:45:18,543
Let her in.

597
00:45:37,389 --> 00:45:40,047
- Could I have a moment alone
with my brother, please?

598
00:45:47,227 --> 00:45:51,990
So, we, uh... we had to clear
out your room.

599
00:45:52,059 --> 00:45:55,131
You know, for Daddy's
hospice bed, and I found...

600
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,443
It's so cute.

601
00:45:56,512 --> 00:46:01,517
It reminded me of when
you were just a wee lad.

602
00:46:01,586 --> 00:46:02,587
- Son of a bitch...

603
00:46:02,656 --> 00:46:04,382
- No, that wasn't it.

604
00:46:04,451 --> 00:46:06,764
It was this...

605
00:46:10,043 --> 00:46:11,458
Look me in the fucking eyes.

606
00:46:11,527 --> 00:46:13,563
- You're fucking crazy
and I will have you arrested.

607
00:46:13,632 --> 00:46:16,049
- I've waited two months
for this moment, Jamie.

608
00:46:16,118 --> 00:46:19,880
Two months of praying
and bartering with God

609
00:46:19,949 --> 00:46:21,330
for his survival.

610
00:46:21,399 --> 00:46:22,780
And guess what?

611
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:27,163
He did survive.

612
00:46:27,232 --> 00:46:28,820
I thought you'd like
to know that seeing as

613
00:46:28,889 --> 00:46:30,339
you never visited once.

614
00:46:30,408 --> 00:46:32,513
You never called once.

615
00:46:32,582 --> 00:46:35,413
- I called every day.
I just didn't call you.

616
00:46:40,349 --> 00:46:41,695
- It was you, wasn't it?

617
00:46:44,663 --> 00:46:46,596
- It was me what?

618
00:46:53,086 --> 00:46:54,363
- I want to tell you something.

619
00:46:56,675 --> 00:46:59,161
And it's for me,
it's not for you...

620
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:02,095
See I want you to know it now,
so you can think about it...

621
00:47:05,029 --> 00:47:08,964
and not sleep
and worry and dread.

622
00:47:14,176 --> 00:47:15,384
I'm going to kill you.

623
00:47:17,317 --> 00:47:21,321
But when I do it, I'm not
going to farm it out like you,

624
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:22,770
you fucking coward.

625
00:47:24,496 --> 00:47:26,498
I'm going to do it myself.

626
00:47:26,567 --> 00:47:28,086
- You think that I would--

627
00:47:28,155 --> 00:47:29,950
- I'm going to kill you, Jamie.

628
00:47:30,019 --> 00:47:33,402
I'm going to fucking kill you
for what you did to my family.

629
00:47:33,471 --> 00:47:34,748
- Think very hard about
what you're saying, Beth:

630
00:47:34,817 --> 00:47:36,129
you are threatening
a state official.

631
00:47:36,198 --> 00:47:38,476
- I am threatening
the whole fucking state.

632
00:47:45,621 --> 00:47:49,107
[music]

633
00:47:49,176 --> 00:47:51,075
[cheering on television]

00:48:01,257 --> 00:48:02,258
[door opens]

635
00:48:19,137 --> 00:48:20,276
[sniffs]

636
00:48:29,044 --> 00:48:30,424
- No picnic working here, huh?

637
00:48:36,085 --> 00:48:37,638
I'm here to say I'm sorry.

638
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:42,747
And I'm here to say thank you.

639
00:48:42,816 --> 00:48:44,991
I'm sorry people came
after you to get to me.

640
00:48:47,821 --> 00:48:49,236
That's not what you
signed up for.

641
00:48:49,305 --> 00:48:50,479
I'm sorry you...

642
00:48:52,067 --> 00:48:53,033
I'm sorry you went
through that.

643
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:56,795
Now to thank you.

644
00:48:56,864 --> 00:48:59,902
And I mean it from
the bottom of my heart:

645
00:49:02,663 --> 00:49:04,182
thank you for fighting back.

646
00:49:07,185 --> 00:49:09,912
Thank you for
protecting this place,

647
00:49:09,981 --> 00:49:11,431
and protecting my family.

648
00:49:14,123 --> 00:49:15,193
I'll never forget it.

649
00:49:18,403 --> 00:49:21,303
Now you, uh...

650
00:49:21,372 --> 00:49:22,960
you stop worrying
about fighting.

651
00:49:25,341 --> 00:49:27,136
Worry about cowboying.
You leave the...

652
00:49:29,518 --> 00:49:30,968
You leave the fighting to me.

653
00:49:34,661 --> 00:49:38,492
Good Lord, looks like you boys
could use some beer, huh?

654
00:49:38,561 --> 00:49:40,598
Hmm.

655
00:49:40,667 --> 00:49:42,186
Oh my goodness.

656
00:49:49,227 --> 00:49:50,746
- You all right to drink, boss?

657
00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:55,716
- Lloyd, I've come to the
conclusion that the only thing

658
00:49:55,785 --> 00:49:59,134
on this earth that
can kill me is me.

659
00:50:00,411 --> 00:50:01,757
Any of you dipshits
feel like

660
00:50:01,826 --> 00:50:04,104
losing a weeks' wages
to the boss?

661
00:50:04,173 --> 00:50:05,312
[laughing]

662
00:50:14,908 --> 00:50:18,601
Can someone explain to me how
this whole deal is working out?

663
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:21,121
- Oh, that.

664
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:24,262
Well, that's what you'd call
a constant state of evolution.

665
00:50:24,331 --> 00:50:28,542
- Well, look at the big
words from Jake.

666
00:50:28,611 --> 00:50:30,096
- Are we playing Hold 'Em?

667
00:50:30,165 --> 00:50:32,926
- We can play anything you
want to lose your money to.

668
00:50:32,995 --> 00:50:36,585
- Just to let you know,
when we play cards we like to...

669
00:50:36,654 --> 00:50:37,827
talk a lot of trash,

670
00:50:37,896 --> 00:50:39,208
so don't get your feelings
hurt, all right?

671
00:50:39,277 --> 00:50:40,658
- If one of you boys think
you can insult me,

672
00:50:40,727 --> 00:50:42,142
give it your best shot.

673
00:50:42,211 --> 00:50:43,661
- Don't mind if I do.

674
00:50:46,181 --> 00:50:48,528
- Alright.
The game's Hold 'Em.

675
00:50:51,496 --> 00:50:52,808
Man: Three, six, king.

676
00:50:56,122 --> 00:50:57,606
- Got it.

677
00:51:00,574 --> 00:51:02,300
[chattering]

678
00:51:14,174 --> 00:51:16,452
- Could you point me
to the restroom?

679
00:51:16,521 --> 00:51:18,592
- Yeah, it's just down
the hallway and to the right.

680
00:51:18,661 --> 00:51:21,181
- I'm going to go first.
Get me a beer.

681
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,295
- Women.

682
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:34,539
- Excuse me?

683
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,542
- I said "women."

684
00:51:40,856 --> 00:51:42,029
- What about us?

685
00:51:44,066 --> 00:51:46,413
- Life is perspective
and you don't have any.

686
00:51:48,519 --> 00:51:50,003
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

687
00:51:50,072 --> 00:51:52,454
- I'm talking about your husband
leaving you here at the bar

688
00:51:52,523 --> 00:51:55,491
to buy him a drink
and do Kiegel exercises

689
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:58,908
while he goes and
powders his nose...

690
00:51:58,977 --> 00:52:00,772
when it should be
the other way around.

691
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:07,503
- Why...should it be
the other way around?

692
00:52:10,299 --> 00:52:13,095
- Because you have all the pussy
and half the money.

693
00:52:14,821 --> 00:52:15,856
That's why.

694
00:52:19,343 --> 00:52:21,690
[laughs]

695
00:52:21,759 --> 00:52:22,725
- I never thought
of it like that.

696
00:52:22,794 --> 00:52:23,899
- Mm-hmm...

697
00:52:25,521 --> 00:52:26,936
It's perspective.

698
00:52:31,596 --> 00:52:32,735
- Where's your man?

699
00:52:34,806 --> 00:52:37,361
- He's on our porch
waiting for me to get home.

700
00:52:38,879 --> 00:52:41,330
- Why aren't you?

701
00:52:41,399 --> 00:52:42,607
- Because I'm in a bad mood.

702
00:52:44,644 --> 00:52:46,163
I don't like to take those home.

703
00:52:48,924 --> 00:52:49,925
- Where's my beer?

704
00:52:51,375 --> 00:52:53,963
- Order your own fucking beer.

705
00:52:54,032 --> 00:52:56,414
And get me a
skinny margarita with Tito's.

706
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:06,252
- Oh, that cheered me up.

707
00:53:23,027 --> 00:53:25,616
[music]

708
00:53:28,688 --> 00:53:29,965
-[groan]

709
00:53:32,347 --> 00:53:33,934
Mmm...

710
00:53:39,354 --> 00:53:41,252
Oh...

711
00:53:42,288 --> 00:53:43,772
- Can't you just sleep in?

712
00:53:45,291 --> 00:53:46,602
- Not today, sweetie.

713
00:53:50,848 --> 00:53:52,505
- Are you telling me no?

714
00:53:54,507 --> 00:53:56,440
- Got something I need
to take care of.

715
00:54:04,862 --> 00:54:06,139
- Damn right, you do.

716
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:12,628
You know, it's faster
just to fuck me

717
00:54:12,697 --> 00:54:15,735
than argue about fucking me
then still fucking me.

718
00:54:15,804 --> 00:54:17,668
-[laughs]

719
00:54:17,737 --> 00:54:20,015
Sweetheart, you don't know
what I have to do.

720
00:54:23,087 --> 00:54:24,226
- Something bad?

721
00:54:26,504 --> 00:54:29,473
- Yeah. Something bad.

722
00:54:31,992 --> 00:54:33,304
