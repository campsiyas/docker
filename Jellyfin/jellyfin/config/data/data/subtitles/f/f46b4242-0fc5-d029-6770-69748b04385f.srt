00:00:35,966 --> 00:00:38,348
What the hell are you doing?

5
00:00:38,383 --> 00:00:39,660
Packing.

6
00:00:39,694 --> 00:00:42,490
You know, I can see that.
But, where are you going?

7
00:00:42,525 --> 00:00:44,354
I don't know.

8
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:47,495
Livingston for a few days
while I figure it out.

10
00:00:48,565 --> 00:00:50,567
Why?
[clears throat]

11
00:00:51,672 --> 00:00:54,606
Because I sacrificed
his little lamb.

12
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,159
What the hell does
that mean, Beth?

13
00:00:56,194 --> 00:00:59,335
Doesn't matter.
He doesn't want me here.

14
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:01,682
And if I've learned
anything about life, it is

15
00:01:01,716 --> 00:01:04,133
not to be somewhere
where you aren't wanted.

16
00:01:04,167 --> 00:01:07,688
Mm-hmm, well, guess what?
You're wanted.

17
00:01:07,722 --> 00:01:09,172
Not by him.

18
00:01:09,207 --> 00:01:10,829
- Beth?
- Yeah.

19
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:12,865
You just put that down for...
Beth?

20
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,419
Just stop.

21
00:01:14,453 --> 00:01:15,903
I...

22
00:01:17,318 --> 00:01:19,355

Hey...

26
00:01:29,572 --> 00:01:33,334
You can run away and then wander
back in a few years

27
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:34,715
and think that
everything's gonna be the same,

28
00:01:34,749 --> 00:01:35,992
but it won't.

29
00:01:38,408 --> 00:01:41,273
I mean, he might be gone.

30
00:01:41,308 --> 00:01:44,552
Shit, this ranch
might be gone.

31
00:01:44,587 --> 00:01:47,037
And when it's gone,
baby, I'm gone.

00:01:51,283 --> 00:01:52,871

I'm sorry. I didn't know
what she meant to you.

[chuckles]

41
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,291
It's not what she means to me,
honey, it's...

42
00:02:34,706 --> 00:02:36,294
It's what's right.
What's decent.

43
00:02:38,744 --> 00:02:42,783
No rules with our enemies,
but she isn't an enemy.

44
00:02:42,817 --> 00:02:46,131
Well, that's an argument
for another time.

45
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:50,031
But... your ranch, your rules.

00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:53,587

my permission to live here.

For me, I do.

52
00:03:17,266 --> 00:03:18,750
Then you have it.

00:03:23,306 --> 00:03:24,687
Thank you.

55
00:03:28,898 --> 00:03:30,555
Yeah?

Hey, baby.

00:04:45,388 --> 00:04:46,493
You can't call me that.

65
00:04:49,116 --> 00:04:50,117
Why not?

66
00:04:52,706 --> 00:04:54,155
Because it's not true.

67
00:04:56,641 --> 00:05:00,679
I just thought 'cause I don't
have one, you could be it.

68
00:05:05,235 --> 00:05:06,236
You been acting like it.

friend, which is what I am.

You don't get another.

72
00:05:18,387 --> 00:05:21,355
I lost mine.
Same goes for me.

73
00:05:22,736 --> 00:05:26,222
And I'm nobody's mother. Ever.
You got it?

74
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:34,264
Crying doesn't help.

75
00:05:40,236 --> 00:05:41,306
Never does.

77
00:06:00,774 --> 00:06:02,362
You were in prison?

00:06:05,123 --> 00:06:06,849
Yeah.

79
00:06:06,883 --> 00:06:11,923
Explain that to me.
Explain prison.

80
00:06:11,957 --> 00:06:13,442
What part?

81
00:06:13,476 --> 00:06:15,064
Could you have visitors?

82
00:06:17,342 --> 00:06:20,897
I didn't have any,
but I guess I could have.

83
00:06:22,934 --> 00:06:25,315

Girlfriends, they can visit?

84
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,386
Yeah.

85
00:06:28,836 --> 00:06:33,703
Can they do more?
Like, conjugals?

86
00:06:33,738 --> 00:06:35,360
Yeah, you can do that.

87
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,189
You just got to
reserve a room.

88
00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:41,711
One last question...

89
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:45,094
how do I get a weapon in?

90
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,237
What kind of weapon?

91
00:06:51,687 --> 00:06:53,102
One that doesn't
look like a weapon.

00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:02,525
Them hair pins
are pretty good.

94
00:07:06,253 --> 00:07:08,531
Just got to give the guards
something else to look at...

95
00:07:11,016 --> 00:07:13,329
I reckon they wouldn't be
too concerned about your hair.

What in the fuck
was that about, Walker?

100
00:07:37,802 --> 00:07:40,183
She was asking me
about prison.

101
00:07:40,218 --> 00:07:41,840
Prison?

102
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,187
Yeah. Think she wants
to kill somebody.

103
00:07:45,706 --> 00:07:48,260
Whatever she told you,
you don't tell anybody else.

104
00:07:48,295 --> 00:07:49,641
You understand me?

105
00:07:49,676 --> 00:07:50,918
Yeah, I got that.

106
00:07:59,962 --> 00:08:01,032

What are you doing?

00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:08,936
My last act before
the kinder, gentler me appears.

109
00:08:08,971 --> 00:08:10,904
I don't need you getting
in trouble, Beth,

110
00:08:10,938 --> 00:08:12,008
or hurt or killed.

111
00:08:12,043 --> 00:08:14,045
If you need something
taken care of

112
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,391
you tell me
and I'll take care of it.

113
00:08:15,425 --> 00:08:16,426
I know, baby.

114
00:08:17,842 --> 00:08:19,326
But this one's just for me.

115
00:08:20,638 --> 00:08:21,604
Okay?

116

overbet the pot here.

Shit.

133
00:11:50,882 --> 00:11:52,608
Betting like
you made the flush.

134
00:11:52,642 --> 00:11:54,196
That's because
I did make the flush.

135
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,025
If you made the flush
you would be acting

136
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,544
like you didn't
make the flush.

137
00:11:57,578 --> 00:12:00,064
You're just trying to put me
off of my flush.

138
00:12:00,098 --> 00:12:01,444
That is
absolutely ass backwards.

139
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:02,825
I am begging you
to match the pot.

Daddy needs a new pair of shoes.

Let me see your face.

142
00:12:05,897 --> 00:12:07,312
You are so full of shit again.

143
00:12:07,347 --> 00:12:08,520
You are bluffing.

144
00:12:08,555 --> 00:12:10,039
If he's bluffing
why are you folding?

145
00:12:10,074 --> 00:12:11,247
I ain't got shit either.

146
00:12:11,282 --> 00:12:12,766
I am bluffing.

147
00:12:12,801 --> 00:12:15,873
- You know what? I'm going to raise you 40...
- Woo!

148
00:12:15,907 --> 00:12:18,082
'cause you're lying
and that's not nice.

149
00:12:18,116 --> 00:12:20,532
Go, girl!
[shouting]

150
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:23,156
Let's put the man
to a decision.

151
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,847
I've already made my decision.

152
00:12:24,882 --> 00:12:26,055
I'm all in.

153
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,091
Me too.

154
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,644
Lloyd: Turn 'em over.

155
00:12:28,678 --> 00:12:29,645
- Let's see 'em.
- Bye.

156
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:31,302
Oh!

157
00:12:31,336 --> 00:12:32,475
Ace, king, seven, Jack.

158
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:35,582
Okay, so you weren't lying...
All right.

159
00:12:35,616 --> 00:12:38,205
But, gee, and all I have
is this Ace and Seven.

160
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,968
Woo!

161
00:12:42,002 --> 00:12:44,867
She went and dry fucked 'em
right there, didn't she?

162
00:12:44,902 --> 00:12:45,765
Yes, she did.

163
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,007
Didn't you three
girls get fired?

164
00:12:47,042 --> 00:12:48,560
He didn't say
we couldn't come back.

165
00:12:48,595 --> 00:12:50,079
That's exactly what it means
when you get fired,

166
00:12:50,114 --> 00:12:51,563
it means you are not supposed
to come back ever.

167
00:12:51,598 --> 00:12:53,186
So, if I get
fired from McDonald's,

168
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,808
I can't ever go
back to McDonald's

169
00:12:54,843 --> 00:12:56,361
and get something to eat?
- She's got a point.

170
00:12:56,396 --> 00:12:58,743
She'd have a point
if we sold hamburgers, Lloyd.

171
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,608
Technically, we kind of
do make hamburgers.

172
00:13:01,642 --> 00:13:05,060
- Hey!
- Well, well, well...

173
00:13:05,094 --> 00:13:06,199
It's the Texican.

174
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:08,235
- Look who it is?
- How y'all doing?

175
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,616
Everyone's great, Jimmy.

176
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,963
Everyone except for Ryan.
- Fuck you.

177
00:13:11,998 --> 00:13:13,516
You can always do one of
those payday loans.

178
00:13:13,551 --> 00:13:17,555
You can see things haven't
changed here. Pull up a chair.

179
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,971
Actually, uh...
I'm gonna need two chairs.

180
00:13:20,006 --> 00:13:21,524
- Why?
- Oh.

181
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,184
Ruh roh.

182
00:13:26,219 --> 00:13:28,842
Oh, that's gonna go over
like a fart in church.

183
00:13:28,877 --> 00:13:30,602
Everyone, this is Emily.

184
00:13:30,637 --> 00:13:32,984
She's a vet down the Sixes.
And, uh...

185
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:34,675
She's my fiancÃ©e.

186
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:35,815
Oh, shit.

187
00:13:40,405 --> 00:13:43,788
No, no, no no!
No fighting!

188
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,618
Let them fight,
they don't even work here.

189
00:13:46,653 --> 00:13:48,620
- Kick her fucking ass!
- Just let them fight.

190
00:13:50,795 --> 00:13:52,866
- Emily! Emily! Emily!
- Oh!

191
00:13:52,901 --> 00:13:54,730
- I got $20 on Texas.
- Yeah!

192
00:13:54,764 --> 00:13:58,803
No, no, no, no!

193
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,081
Fucking barrel racers.

194
00:14:01,116 --> 00:14:02,807
- That's enough, come on!
- Fuck you!

195
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,464
Fuck!

196
00:14:04,498 --> 00:14:07,950
Whoa. Whoa.

197
00:14:07,985 --> 00:14:10,470
- Frickin' mess!
- Well, shit!

198
00:14:10,504 --> 00:14:13,438
Always good to exercise
after a long drive.

199
00:14:13,473 --> 00:14:14,957
What're the chances
there's some whiskey in here?

200
00:14:14,992 --> 00:14:17,235
- Chances are good.
- Chances are good.

201
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,824
Nice hook.
- [sighs]

202
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,688
[laughs]

203
00:14:24,518 --> 00:14:26,486
Looks like this one's free.

204
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,521
It is now.

205
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:32,457
- What's the game?
- Whatever you want it to be.

206
00:14:32,492 --> 00:14:34,494
Let me fucking go!

207
00:14:36,772 --> 00:14:38,084
How fucking dare
you bring her here?

208
00:14:38,118 --> 00:14:39,361
How was I supposed
to know you're going to be here?

209
00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:40,949
You don't fucking work here!

210
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,332
You said you were
done with me.

211
00:14:45,367 --> 00:14:46,678
And now it's the
other way around.

212
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,475
Yeah.

213
00:14:52,995 --> 00:14:55,377
God. You didn't fight.

214
00:14:55,411 --> 00:14:56,654
Not even a little.

215
00:14:57,793 --> 00:14:58,932
I took you at your word.

216
00:15:00,623 --> 00:15:04,179
You said that if I left
we were through. I left.

217
00:15:04,213 --> 00:15:05,525
And I met her.

218
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:08,769
And I...
And I fell in love.

219
00:15:08,804 --> 00:15:10,806
And when I had to leave there
and come back here

220
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,913
she chose an option that
you and I didn't discuss:

221
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:15,086
she chose to come with me.

222
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,813
So, it's my fault.

223
00:15:20,436 --> 00:15:21,437
It's nobody's fault.

224
00:15:23,025 --> 00:15:24,578
I had a lot of growing up to do.

225
00:15:24,613 --> 00:15:26,995
I wish that I'd done it before
you and I met, but I didn't.

226
00:15:31,482 --> 00:15:33,242
Okay.

227
00:15:33,277 --> 00:15:35,762
Just forget everything that's
happened before right now.

228
00:15:35,796 --> 00:15:36,797
All right. Choose.

229
00:15:37,798 --> 00:15:39,662
Choose.
Her or me.

230
00:15:39,697 --> 00:15:40,698
- Mia...
- Choose!

231
00:15:44,633 --> 00:15:46,152
[sighs, sniffs]

232
00:15:53,883 --> 00:15:55,955
Take me home, Laramie.

233
00:15:56,886 --> 00:15:59,751
[music]

234
00:16:08,174 --> 00:16:10,728
[sniffs]

235
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:11,763
I'm sorry, sir.
I didn't see you there.
[clears throat]

236
00:16:14,283 --> 00:16:17,286
Walked down to see the horse.

237
00:16:17,321 --> 00:16:19,806
Didn't seem
like a conversation

238
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,359
I wanted to interrupt.

239
00:16:21,394 --> 00:16:23,879
Well, to be honest, I wouldn't
have minded the interruption.

240
00:16:25,122 --> 00:16:27,365
Yeah.
It, uh...

241
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,435
It had that look.

242
00:16:30,748 --> 00:16:32,336
Come on.

243
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,854
Come show me the horse.

244
00:16:39,964 --> 00:16:43,105
[music]

245
00:16:54,185 --> 00:16:55,255
[horse snorts]

246
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,050
You want me to take
that blanket off him?

247
00:16:57,085 --> 00:16:58,051
Nah.

248
00:17:00,295 --> 00:17:03,574
You know, I've never figured
out a way to look at one

249
00:17:03,608 --> 00:17:05,852
and know if it had
a shred of talent or heart.

250
00:17:07,095 --> 00:17:10,167
But if you look
at all this horse has done,

251
00:17:10,201 --> 00:17:11,892
and all his babies have done...

252
00:17:13,894 --> 00:17:16,966
I guess that's what
talent and heart looks like.

253
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:19,417
[chuckles]

254
00:17:21,454 --> 00:17:25,216
I see you drove up
here in the four sixes truck.

255
00:17:25,251 --> 00:17:27,356
Yes, sir.

256
00:17:27,391 --> 00:17:29,220
My fiancee'll drive it back
with her when she goes.

257
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,258
FiancÃ©e.

258
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,365
Yes, sir.
[chuckles]

259
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,436
Oh.

260
00:17:38,471 --> 00:17:41,715
Now the fiancee's gonna
drive back

261
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,408
and you're not going with her?

262
00:17:45,892 --> 00:17:48,446
I'm going to work off
what I owe you.

263
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:49,585
Then we'll figure it out.

264
00:17:51,173 --> 00:17:56,075
So the wedding's gonna
be in, what, 75 years?

265
00:17:56,109 --> 00:18:00,941
- [chuckles]
- [John laughs]

266
00:18:00,976 --> 00:18:02,357
I broke my word to you once.

267
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,292
Almost did it again
to stay with her.

268
00:18:08,811 --> 00:18:10,399
No, I'm going to pay you
what I owe.

269
00:18:12,332 --> 00:18:14,162
Texas was good for you.

270
00:18:15,646 --> 00:18:17,786
Yes, sir, I think it was.
[chuckles]

271
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,620
Only person you owe
is yourself, Jim.

272
00:18:27,796 --> 00:18:29,763
You don't owe me a thing.

273
00:18:32,628 --> 00:18:35,114
Thank you, sir.

274
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:40,153
[music]

275
00:18:40,188 --> 00:18:42,051
No matter what you decide,
or...

276
00:18:43,536 --> 00:18:47,609
how it works out, you
always have a place right here.

277
00:18:47,643 --> 00:18:52,407
[music]

278
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,569
You're not doing
what he asked.

279
00:19:22,575 --> 00:19:26,441
He said pray for a vision.

280
00:19:26,475 --> 00:19:28,270
But I don't see you praying.

281
00:19:32,516 --> 00:19:34,000
[laughs]

282
00:19:35,622 --> 00:19:37,003
So... What are you doing here?

283
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,041
You need help?

284
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:47,565
Let me in.
I can help you.

285
00:19:51,051 --> 00:19:52,191
I can't.

286
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,403
Just open the doors.

287
00:20:02,442 --> 00:20:05,687
They told me not to.
[laughs]

288
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,311
I'm your brother.

289
00:20:10,726 --> 00:20:11,727
Let me help you.

290
00:20:17,595 --> 00:20:18,976
They won't let me.

291
00:20:22,807 --> 00:20:25,224
Let me in, you fucking child!
Look at me!

292
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:27,122
- [screams]
- This is your vision!

293
00:20:27,156 --> 00:20:29,158
This is your destiny!

294
00:20:29,193 --> 00:20:30,712
[screaming]

295
00:20:30,746 --> 00:20:32,403
Baby, shh.

296
00:20:32,438 --> 00:20:34,302
It's just a dream.

297
00:20:34,336 --> 00:20:36,096
Shhhh.

298
00:20:36,683 --> 00:20:40,963
[sinister music]

299
00:20:44,381 --> 00:20:45,623
It's just a dream.

300
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,248
[wolf howls]

301
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,395

[cows lowing]

304
00:21:36,433 --> 00:21:38,849
Hey, start looking
for that son of a bitch!

305
00:21:38,883 --> 00:21:40,437
He might be laid up
in them trees

306
00:21:40,471 --> 00:21:42,784
or that deep grass over there.

307
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:43,888
I got him.

308
00:21:46,374 --> 00:21:48,479
You weren't in
Texas that long.

309
00:21:48,514 --> 00:21:49,860
Let him try, Lloyd,
let him try.

310
00:21:49,894 --> 00:21:51,102
Go on, Jimmy.

311
00:21:51,137 --> 00:21:53,173
[music]

312
00:21:54,623 --> 00:21:56,418
[lowing]

313
00:22:07,671 --> 00:22:09,535
He didn't run like
he has pneumonia, did he?

314
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:11,122
No, Jimmy.
He sure didn't.

315
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:16,921
Let him go.

316
00:22:16,956 --> 00:22:18,785
You toss one hell
of a loop, Jimmy.

317
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,168
Yeah, you may make
a team roper yet.

318
00:22:22,202 --> 00:22:23,687
Spend enough time roping
during the day

319
00:22:23,721 --> 00:22:25,654
I don't have to go waste my
nights doing it.

320
00:22:25,689 --> 00:22:26,931
That's like a dentist
going home

321
00:22:26,966 --> 00:22:28,001
and looking at
pictures of teeth.

322
00:22:28,036 --> 00:22:29,348
Whatever you say, Tex.

323
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:34,974
I'll be damned. Look who went
off and become a cowboy.

324
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:38,426
Yeah, it seems that way,
doesn't it, Lloyd?

325
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:41,705
Any more in here?

326
00:22:41,739 --> 00:22:42,982
I don't believe so.

327
00:22:43,016 --> 00:22:45,674
Let's just do a little
once-over though, yeah?

328
00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:46,986
Okay.

329
00:22:50,714 --> 00:22:52,509
[door opens]

330
00:22:55,995 --> 00:22:58,273
When people come here,

331
00:22:58,307 --> 00:23:01,207
they expect their opponents
to be a bunch of rednecks.

332
00:23:01,241 --> 00:23:04,210
People of the land,
I guess you could say...

333
00:23:05,349 --> 00:23:06,971
They don't expect you.

334
00:23:07,006 --> 00:23:08,904
They don't expect a fight.

335
00:23:08,939 --> 00:23:10,596
That's why you have been

336
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,771
such an effective
nuisance for so long.

337
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:18,949
I, however, was aware
of just what a huge problem

338
00:23:18,983 --> 00:23:21,054
you could be.
I was prepared...

339
00:23:21,089 --> 00:23:24,368
I gave you enough rope
to hang yourself,

340
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,682
and oh boy did you
fucking hang yourself.

341
00:23:27,716 --> 00:23:31,962
You have violated everything

342
00:23:31,996 --> 00:23:34,827
from the terms of your
contract to your NDA.

343
00:23:34,861 --> 00:23:39,038
You have committed
corporate espionage.

344
00:23:43,042 --> 00:23:45,734
I don't know
anything about that.

345
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:49,186
Look at the ease
with which you lie.

346
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:53,362
Do you think I don't know
anyone at the Times?

347
00:23:53,397 --> 00:23:55,882
We own that fucking building!

348
00:23:55,917 --> 00:23:58,402
[music]

349
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,749
[sighs] What do you
suppose we'll find

350
00:24:00,784 --> 00:24:04,408
when I subpoena the little
hippie's call records?

351
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,961
And the reporters.

352
00:24:05,996 --> 00:24:07,618
Good luck with that.

353
00:24:07,653 --> 00:24:09,586
First Amendment and all...

354
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,592
I manage the largest private
fund in the world.

355
00:24:15,626 --> 00:24:17,456
And you know what you've done?

356
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,389
You've made it personal for me.

357
00:24:20,424 --> 00:24:24,186
I don't care how much we spend,
or how long it takes,

358
00:24:24,221 --> 00:24:30,330
I'm gonna put a public restroom
where your fucking house is.

359
00:24:30,365 --> 00:24:35,508
I'm gonna chop down every tree,
and dam every creek.

360
00:24:35,543 --> 00:24:40,513
I am going to rape
your fucking ranch to death.

361
00:24:40,548 --> 00:24:45,691
And you, you little bitch,
are going to prison.

362
00:24:48,452 --> 00:24:50,419
Needless to say, you're fired.

363
00:25:04,813 --> 00:25:06,539
Gonna be late for my date.

364
00:25:12,718 --> 00:25:14,685
See ya, Cal.

365
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,791
You've been as
uninteresting as I expected.

366
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,518
Ma'am?

367
00:25:28,768 --> 00:25:30,321

368
00:25:30,356 --> 00:25:31,909
John Dutton here to see you.

369
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:34,325
Send him in.

370
00:25:35,913 --> 00:25:36,914
Thank you.

371
00:25:38,744 --> 00:25:41,505
John.

372
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,886
Hello, Mitch.

373
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,751
You walk pretty good
for a man who got shot.

374
00:25:45,785 --> 00:25:48,374
I play eighteen holes,
I can't walk for a month.

375
00:25:48,408 --> 00:25:50,514
Well, it's been
a few months now.

376
00:25:53,172 --> 00:25:54,414
I stand corrected.

377
00:25:54,449 --> 00:25:56,278
Have a seat.

378
00:25:56,313 --> 00:25:57,590
What can I do for you?

379
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,871
I wanna talk about
this Summer Higgins case.

380
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,254
You know her?

381
00:26:06,288 --> 00:26:08,221
Little bit.

382
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,396
From what I know
she's not a criminal.

383
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:12,640
Overly passionate, maybe...

384
00:26:12,674 --> 00:26:16,126
John, she's an
environmental terrorist.

385
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,922
Forty-two arrests
in a dozen states.

386
00:26:18,956 --> 00:26:21,027
I've put many an
armed robber in prison,

387
00:26:21,062 --> 00:26:23,409
they're equally as passionate
about their position.

388
00:26:23,443 --> 00:26:25,929
But because these people
think that their cause

389
00:26:25,963 --> 00:26:27,620
has some moral high ground

390
00:26:27,655 --> 00:26:29,622
they think the laws
don't apply to them.

391
00:26:29,657 --> 00:26:32,073
But the laws
they break are still broken.

392
00:26:32,107 --> 00:26:33,557
An officer was still assaulted,

393
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,559
land was still vandalized,

394
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,803
and property was
still destroyed.

395
00:26:37,837 --> 00:26:40,495
My obligation is
to the rule of law,

396
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:42,601
which is eroding everywhere.

397
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:46,087
Not here.
Not on my watch.

398
00:26:46,121 --> 00:26:47,847
So you're willing
to send her to prison

399
00:26:47,882 --> 00:26:49,400
for the rest of her life?

400
00:26:49,435 --> 00:26:53,404
I instructed council on both
sides to ignore her motivation,

401
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:55,579
focus on the damage,

402
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,443
and bring me a plea
agreement with some weight.

403
00:27:00,446 --> 00:27:02,966
But you speaking
on her behalf has weight too,

404
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,623
and I'll take it
into consideration.

405
00:27:08,523 --> 00:27:09,524
I appreciate it, Mitch.

406
00:27:11,664 --> 00:27:14,460
John, I want to be clear:

407
00:27:16,462 --> 00:27:17,636
she is going to prison.

408
00:27:18,913 --> 00:27:20,880
Only thing to debate
is how long.

409
00:27:20,915 --> 00:27:23,883

What the fuck is this?

413
00:27:48,183 --> 00:27:49,391
It's your conjugal.

414
00:27:49,426 --> 00:27:51,808
I don't have
a fucking conjugal.

415
00:27:51,842 --> 00:27:53,050
We can take you back
to your cell if you want.

416
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,915
Let me figure this out.

417
00:28:13,381 --> 00:28:15,763
Well, this place
is depressing as hell.

418
00:28:16,936 --> 00:28:18,282
It's prison.

419
00:28:19,456 --> 00:28:21,113
It's all depressing.

420
00:28:21,147 --> 00:28:24,116
I'd love to shine
a blue light on that couch.

421
00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:28,430
Who are you?

422
00:28:30,467 --> 00:28:32,641
I'm one of the people
you tried to kill.

423
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,541
I don't know you
to want to kill you.

424
00:28:39,372 --> 00:28:41,064
You tried to kill my father.

425
00:28:41,098 --> 00:28:43,204
And my brother.

426
00:28:45,102 --> 00:28:46,172
You're a Dutton.

427
00:28:46,207 --> 00:28:47,553
Bingo.

428
00:28:49,072 --> 00:28:53,524
Look, like I told the other
guy: the order came in.

429
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:54,836
I sent it out.

430
00:28:54,871 --> 00:28:56,976
For me, it's just business.

431
00:28:58,046 --> 00:28:59,323
What other guy?

432
00:28:59,358 --> 00:29:02,430
The suit.
The lawyer.

433
00:29:02,464 --> 00:29:03,776
The one in the papers.

434
00:29:07,607 --> 00:29:08,850
This lawyer?

435
00:29:08,885 --> 00:29:10,576
That's the one.

436
00:29:26,695 --> 00:29:28,939
You know you're going
to die here, right?

437
00:29:30,216 --> 00:29:32,391
Yep.

438
00:29:32,425 --> 00:29:36,257
When you're old and weak
and you can barely take a piss

439
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:38,915
and it's been so long since
you had any decent food

440
00:29:38,949 --> 00:29:42,504
that you actually look forward
to the fish fry on Fridays

441
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:45,438
and you're waiting to die
and everyone that you've known

442
00:29:45,473 --> 00:29:49,235
is gone or forgotten you,

443
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,650
you will realize...

444
00:29:54,033 --> 00:29:56,139
they have you perfectly trained.

445
00:30:03,284 --> 00:30:07,667
Trained to stand up,
trained to sit down,

446
00:30:07,702 --> 00:30:10,739
trained to line up,
trained to sleep.

447
00:30:12,327 --> 00:30:16,090
And you will realize
that your time on this planet

448
00:30:16,124 --> 00:30:19,438
has been an utter waste
and failure.

449
00:30:19,472 --> 00:30:23,373
And you will know
in your heart

450
00:30:23,407 --> 00:30:26,031
that this world would have been
a better place without you.

451
00:30:28,965 --> 00:30:32,106
And then you'll
remember me telling you.

452
00:30:39,734 --> 00:30:42,288
You know, life isn't
a longevity contest.

453
00:30:44,014 --> 00:30:47,431
It's a contest in quality:

454
00:30:47,466 --> 00:30:50,710
what good you can get from life,
what good you can give it.

455
00:30:50,745 --> 00:30:53,437
And your life is already over.

456
00:30:53,472 --> 00:30:55,163
You're just waiting to die.

457
00:31:00,134 --> 00:31:02,274
I hope you wait
'til you're a hundred.

00:34:25,511 --> 00:34:26,823
I'm not much of a fighter.

537
00:34:28,652 --> 00:34:29,964
I might make a cowboy yet.

538
00:34:35,038 --> 00:34:38,938
Hell, Jimmy,
You're a cowboy already.

539
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,634
[music]

540
00:34:51,296 --> 00:34:52,918
[voice trembling]
Good luck.

541
00:34:56,266 --> 00:34:59,787
[music]

542
00:35:47,075 --> 00:35:48,594
Did you try calling her?

543
00:35:48,629 --> 00:35:49,768
Yeah, she didn't answer.

544
00:35:53,012 --> 00:35:54,186
Should I be worried?

545
00:35:54,221 --> 00:35:56,154
Think I'm worried
enough for both of us.

546
00:36:01,262 --> 00:36:03,057
Sorry I'm late.

547
00:36:03,091 --> 00:36:06,992
So, before dinner I've got a
little business to take care of.

548
00:36:09,132 --> 00:36:10,306
Everybody outside.

549
00:36:13,688 --> 00:36:14,965
What business, honey?

550
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,105
Everybody out, come on!

551
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,141
Outside.

552
00:36:19,591 --> 00:36:20,557
Come on, let's go.

553
00:36:27,909 --> 00:36:29,083
Give me a hand, would ya?

554
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,292
Beth...

555
00:36:32,914 --> 00:36:34,847
What the hell
are you doing?

556
00:36:34,882 --> 00:36:37,056
There's something
that I gotta do tomorrow, Dad,

557
00:36:37,091 --> 00:36:39,818
and I want to be a
married woman when I do it.

558
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:46,204
Honey, let's do this right.

559
00:36:46,238 --> 00:36:47,446
Let me plan--

560
00:36:47,481 --> 00:36:49,862
I don't give a shit
about the wedding, Dad.

561
00:36:49,897 --> 00:36:51,761
I just care about the marriage.

562
00:36:51,795 --> 00:36:54,350
Sweetheart, that's a priest.

563
00:36:54,384 --> 00:36:55,592
We aren't fucking Catholic.

564
00:36:57,111 --> 00:36:58,077
I don't care.

565
00:36:58,112 --> 00:36:59,769
He can sign the thing, right?

566
00:36:59,803 --> 00:37:01,149
That's all that matters...

567
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:10,918
We're getting married.

568
00:37:12,816 --> 00:37:14,301
You okay with this?

569
00:37:14,335 --> 00:37:18,305
Beth, you are so
fucking crazy.

570
00:37:18,339 --> 00:37:21,549
I thought you wanted to find
a place that was just ours.

571
00:37:21,584 --> 00:37:22,619
I do.

572
00:37:24,172 --> 00:37:25,967
We will take that ride,
I promise.

573
00:37:28,073 --> 00:37:30,144
Sweetheart, if it makes
you happy, I'm happy.

574
00:37:32,111 --> 00:37:33,596
There's two things
I gotta grab real quick.

575
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,425
Just give me one second,
all right?

576
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,599
Be right back.

577
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:39,912
Look, I'm just sayin'
it's not chili.

578
00:37:39,947 --> 00:37:42,398
- It's chili.
- It's got beans in it.

579
00:37:42,432 --> 00:37:44,227
The whole point of chili
is to use up all the shit

580
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,746
you got in you kitchen, you can
put anything you want in it.

581
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,057
No, no, that's stew.

582
00:37:47,092 --> 00:37:49,197
As soon as you put beans
in chili it ain't chili.

583
00:37:49,232 --> 00:37:50,785
Then what the fuck
do they call this in Texas?

584
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,304
They don't call it anything
because it doesn't exist,

585
00:37:52,339 --> 00:37:53,305
it's got beans in it.

586
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,858
They don't eat beans in Texas.

587
00:37:54,893 --> 00:37:56,377
They eat beans all day they
just don't eat them in chili.

588
00:37:56,412 --> 00:37:58,034
So why the fuck does
Texas get to decide

589
00:37:58,068 --> 00:38:00,036
what the fuck goes in chili?
- Because they invented it.

590
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,796
Will y'all shut the fuck up?

591
00:38:01,831 --> 00:38:04,109
I can't eat whatever
the fuck you call it

592
00:38:04,143 --> 00:38:06,111
with you assholes jabbering.

593
00:38:06,145 --> 00:38:08,251
It's good,
it's just not chili.

594
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,667
Lloyd. I need you.
Grab your stuff, will you?

595
00:38:10,702 --> 00:38:11,875
Hey, Rip, will you tell them?

596
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,014
If you put beans in chili,
is it still chili?

597
00:38:13,049 --> 00:38:14,119
Jimmy, shut the fuck up.

598
00:38:14,153 --> 00:38:16,224
Nobody cares about
your goddamn chili.

599
00:38:16,259 --> 00:38:19,297
Yeah, fuck you, Jimmy.
You still owe me a rope.

600
00:38:19,331 --> 00:38:21,402
- Some things just never change.
- But I got to tell you...

601
00:38:21,437 --> 00:38:25,958
This is some damn good chili.

602
00:38:25,993 --> 00:38:28,029
You know, when your mom
makes chili, no beans.

603
00:38:28,064 --> 00:38:29,410
Don't start this shit again.

604
00:38:29,445 --> 00:38:31,412
I feel really bad,
I should have said something

605
00:38:31,447 --> 00:38:33,034
before we came.

606
00:38:33,069 --> 00:38:34,001
I had a very, very brief
relationship

607
00:38:34,035 --> 00:38:35,105
with Colby's mother.

608
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,728
- Here we go!
- It wasn't love.

609
00:38:36,762 --> 00:38:39,040
At least not for me.
I can't speak for her.

610
00:38:39,075 --> 00:38:40,594
It was very, very physical.

611
00:38:40,628 --> 00:38:41,733
Jimmy, I'm gonna
come across this table.

612
00:38:41,767 --> 00:38:42,941
Okay, I'm sorry.

613
00:38:42,975 --> 00:38:44,183
Although it's crazy
you would say that,

614
00:38:44,218 --> 00:38:45,806
that's exactly what
I did with your mom.

615
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,498
- Oh!
- That's it!

616
00:38:48,533 --> 00:38:50,293
[laughing]

617
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,226
I'll break your neck again and
send you back to the hospital!

618
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,261
I'm sorry.

619
00:38:54,228 --> 00:38:57,507
[music]

620
00:38:57,542 --> 00:38:59,095
Where we going?

621
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:00,855
Wedding.

622
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:02,201
Yours?

623
00:39:02,236 --> 00:39:04,134
Yes, sir.
[laughter]

624
00:39:04,169 --> 00:39:07,137
We ain't had
the bachelor party yet.

625
00:39:07,172 --> 00:39:09,588
Lloyd, we're doing
everything ass backwards, buddy.

626
00:39:09,623 --> 00:39:11,176
You'll be married
and we won't be able to do

627
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:12,867
any of the shit I'm planning.

628
00:39:14,179 --> 00:39:16,250
- The groom is...
- Big guy, black hat.

629
00:39:17,251 --> 00:39:19,736
So...
You stand here.

630
00:39:19,771 --> 00:39:22,463
And, uh...

631
00:39:22,498 --> 00:39:26,225
You'll take her hand
and walk her here to the...

632
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,572
What would be an altar.

633
00:39:27,606 --> 00:39:28,814
And you are...

634
00:39:28,849 --> 00:39:29,815
I'm the best man.

635
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:30,954
You stand beside him.

636
00:39:33,785 --> 00:39:35,545
I'm just the stall cleaner.

637
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,582
Stall cleaner
can stay where he is.

638
00:39:37,616 --> 00:39:39,929
And uh, here we go...

639
00:39:41,033 --> 00:39:42,380
Beth...

640
00:39:42,414 --> 00:39:45,175
Beth, you can't wear
that dress at your wedding.

641
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:47,902
Don't worry, Daddy.
I won't be wearing it long.

642
00:39:47,937 --> 00:39:50,698
Beth, I am not your buddy.
Okay, I'm your...

643
00:39:50,733 --> 00:39:52,113
I'm your father.

644
00:39:52,148 --> 00:39:54,702
So can you factor that in to
our conversations going forward?

645
00:39:54,737 --> 00:39:56,152
Okay.

646
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:00,190
- Ready?
- Yeah.

647
00:40:00,225 --> 00:40:02,917
I love you.

648
00:40:02,952 --> 00:40:09,752
[music]

649
00:40:09,786 --> 00:40:11,305
Honey...

650
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:13,825
I hope you'll let me do
this again for you.

651
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:15,413
And do it right.

652
00:40:16,655 --> 00:40:18,554
You can do it
any way you want it.

653
00:40:19,762 --> 00:40:20,970
All right.

654
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,913
Who presents the bride?

655
00:40:32,947 --> 00:40:36,226
Me. I'm--I'm her father.

656
00:40:46,927 --> 00:40:50,275
So normally I would say a few
things about the couple,

657
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:53,347
but I don't have any
idea who you people are,

658
00:40:53,381 --> 00:40:56,454
so I will just move
onward to the vows.

659
00:41:01,217 --> 00:41:03,564
I, state your name...

660
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,497
I, Rip Wheeler...

661
00:41:05,532 --> 00:41:07,430
Do take...
state her name...

662
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,984
to be my lawful
wedded bride.

663
00:41:10,019 --> 00:41:13,401
Take Beth Dutton to be my
lawful wedded bride.

664
00:41:13,436 --> 00:41:17,302
To have and to hold,
to honor and cherish,

665
00:41:17,336 --> 00:41:18,786
from this day forward,

666
00:41:18,821 --> 00:41:22,100
for better or worse,
for richer or poorer,

667
00:41:22,134 --> 00:41:27,519
in sickness and in health,
until death do us part.

668
00:41:27,554 --> 00:41:31,074
To honor and to love

669
00:41:31,109 --> 00:41:34,492
to cherish through
everything...

670
00:41:34,526 --> 00:41:36,839
until I die.

671
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:40,152
And then somehow longer, baby.

672
00:41:43,259 --> 00:41:45,675
And now, Miss Dutton,
repeat after me:

673
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:48,506
I, Beth Dutton--
- Fuck yes, I do.

674
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,784
Not yet, uhm...

675
00:41:52,544 --> 00:41:54,408
You do, I suppose.

676
00:41:55,754 --> 00:41:56,893
Are there rings?

677
00:41:56,928 --> 00:41:57,929
No rings.

678
00:41:57,963 --> 00:41:59,793
No, I have one.

679
00:42:00,932 --> 00:42:02,243
Here it is.

680
00:42:03,141 --> 00:42:04,660
Beth: What?

681
00:42:08,215 --> 00:42:10,389
It was my mother's ring.

682
00:42:10,424 --> 00:42:13,289
We didn't have much, Beth,
we were poor,

683
00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:15,463
but it's yours.

684
00:42:16,775 --> 00:42:18,570
So am I.

685
00:42:22,885 --> 00:42:25,439
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

686
00:42:25,473 --> 00:42:28,269
[laughing]

687
00:42:31,894 --> 00:42:33,240
Beth: We're married.

688
00:42:36,726 --> 00:42:39,695
Thank you, uh...

689
00:42:39,729 --> 00:42:41,075
Thank you for
doing this, Father.

690
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:43,112
You're welcome.

691
00:42:43,146 --> 00:42:46,529
And don't worry,
I won't press charges.

692
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,186
Charges?

693
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,050
Sorry, Daddy.
I had to kidnap him.

694
00:42:51,603 --> 00:42:53,847
If I could get a ride
back to my church,

695
00:42:53,881 --> 00:42:56,504
I would appreciate it.
- Hold on. Hold on...

696
00:42:56,539 --> 00:42:59,473
How exactly did she kidnap you?

697
00:42:59,507 --> 00:43:02,683
- Pistol.
- It was just a little one.

698
00:43:03,995 --> 00:43:05,548
Tiny.
- Come on.

699
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:09,379
Jesus Christ.

700
00:43:09,414 --> 00:43:11,278
Excuse me, Father.

701
00:43:11,312 --> 00:43:12,728
Why don't I take
you home myself?

702
00:43:14,764 --> 00:43:16,801
Lloyd: Damn, that was beautiful.

703
00:43:16,835 --> 00:43:18,596
They all like that?

704
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:21,150
Hell, kid, ain't none
of 'em like that.

Hey!

00:45:22,547 --> 00:45:23,721
Give me eyes up top.

715
00:45:27,966 --> 00:45:30,866
Knight 33, this is Bravo One.

716
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,626
Be advised,
the beacon is in place.

717
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:34,076
[explosion]

718
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:36,423
[sobbing, gunfire]

719
00:46:05,314 --> 00:46:07,972
[explosion]

720
00:46:08,006 --> 00:46:09,387
[music]

721
00:46:10,595 --> 00:46:13,805
[muted explosions]

722
00:46:18,085 --> 00:46:19,949
[muted gunfire]

723
00:46:35,965 --> 00:46:37,380
[screaming]

724
00:46:44,249 --> 00:46:48,081
[wolves howling]

725
00:46:57,090 --> 00:47:01,025
[panting]

726
00:47:02,785 --> 00:47:07,928
[wolves continue howling]

727
00:47:07,963 --> 00:47:13,382
[music]

728
00:47:36,094 --> 00:47:37,233
Thank you for coming.

729
00:47:37,268 --> 00:47:38,648
Did you talk to the judge?

730
00:47:38,683 --> 00:47:40,616
- We talked.
- And?

731
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:41,893
And he listened.

732
00:47:41,928 --> 00:47:43,619
We're about to find
out how much.

733
00:47:43,653 --> 00:47:45,034
All rise.

734
00:47:48,762 --> 00:47:50,695
The state of Montana
vs. Summer Higgins,

735
00:47:50,729 --> 00:47:52,421
Judge Mitchell
Davis presiding.

736
00:47:55,562 --> 00:47:58,082
Be seated.

737
00:47:58,116 --> 00:48:00,981
At the arraignment, your client
issued a plea of not guilty.

738
00:48:01,016 --> 00:48:02,534
Does your client wish
to change her plea?

739
00:48:02,569 --> 00:48:03,915
She does your honor.

740
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:05,192
If it please the court,
may council approach?

741
00:48:05,227 --> 00:48:06,400
Council may approach.

742
00:48:11,612 --> 00:48:13,097
They're entering
your plea agreement now.

743
00:48:13,131 --> 00:48:16,410
The judge will ask you
to reverse your plea.

744
00:48:16,445 --> 00:48:18,896
Once you do that, you are
at the mercy of the court.

745
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:21,070
No, we agreed
to a suspended sentence--

746
00:48:21,105 --> 00:48:24,694
No, your attorneys agreed.
Not the judge.

747
00:48:24,729 --> 00:48:26,627
The judge does
not have to honor it.

748
00:48:30,114 --> 00:48:31,080
What should I do?

749
00:48:33,082 --> 00:48:35,222
Summer, I...

750
00:48:35,257 --> 00:48:37,776
I trust a jury
more than I trust the judge.

751
00:48:37,811 --> 00:48:39,640
Will the defendant
please rise?

752
00:48:42,333 --> 00:48:45,025
Council has presented the court
with a plea agreement.

753
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:47,027
Are you aware of this agreement?

754
00:48:47,062 --> 00:48:48,615
I am your honor.

755
00:48:48,649 --> 00:48:50,272
Do you wish to change
your plea to guilty?

756
00:48:53,137 --> 00:48:54,828
I do, your honor.

757
00:48:54,862 --> 00:48:57,141
Your plea is changed
to a plea of guilty.

758
00:48:57,175 --> 00:49:00,213
In exchange for your plea
the State is offering

759
00:49:00,247 --> 00:49:02,560
a fifteen year
suspended sentence

760
00:49:02,594 --> 00:49:04,148
and a ten thousand dollar fine.

761
00:49:04,182 --> 00:49:05,563
Are you aware
of this plea offer?

762
00:49:05,597 --> 00:49:06,840
I am, your honor.

763
00:49:13,536 --> 00:49:17,885
When imposing a sentence,
this court must consider

764
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,923
many factors, motive
being one of them.

765
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,788
Many courts in the past
have confused your intentions

766
00:49:23,822 --> 00:49:25,583
with motive.

767
00:49:25,617 --> 00:49:30,001
Your intention, Miss Higgins,
may be to affect policy change,

768
00:49:30,036 --> 00:49:33,522
or bring awareness to issues.

769
00:49:33,556 --> 00:49:36,525
But that is not your motive.

770
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,458
That is not your motive
when you throw rocks

771
00:49:38,492 --> 00:49:40,218
and frozen water bottles.

772
00:49:40,253 --> 00:49:44,464
When you damage private property
and defy lawful orders.

773
00:49:44,498 --> 00:49:49,607
Your motive then
is to destroy and disrupt.

774
00:49:49,641 --> 00:49:54,681
And the result of that is
the erosion of the rule of law.

775
00:49:54,715 --> 00:49:58,271
When courts dismiss
your unlawful acts

776
00:49:58,305 --> 00:50:01,550
they are weakening
the rule of law,

777
00:50:01,584 --> 00:50:03,897
and creating avenues
of opportunity

778
00:50:03,931 --> 00:50:09,454
for people whose sole intent
is theft and violence.

779
00:50:09,489 --> 00:50:12,975
And they prey on the most
vulnerable in our society.

780
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:17,704
The elderly, the young,
the weak, the poor.

781
00:50:17,738 --> 00:50:21,121
They prey on those least likely
to recover from the attack.

782
00:50:21,156 --> 00:50:24,366
And you, Miss Higgins,
pave the way for them.

783
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,265
I am not swayed by
your college education

784
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,129
and your outreach work
in the community,

785
00:50:29,164 --> 00:50:31,442
in fact the opposite.

786
00:50:31,476 --> 00:50:33,340
You know better.

787
00:50:33,375 --> 00:50:35,549
If you wish to change laws,

788
00:50:35,584 --> 00:50:39,139
run for office or vote for those
who wish to change them as well.

789
00:50:39,174 --> 00:50:44,731
I look at your file
and I see a career criminal,

790
00:50:44,765 --> 00:50:47,285
who has deluded herself
into believing

791
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,562
that she is not
a criminal

792
00:50:48,597 --> 00:50:50,771
because she believes
she is right.

793
00:50:50,806 --> 00:50:54,154
And you may be right,
Miss Higgins,

794
00:50:54,189 --> 00:50:56,812
But that does not exempt
you from the laws

795
00:50:56,846 --> 00:50:58,607
of this state and this nation.

796
00:50:58,641 --> 00:51:01,713
For the two counts of
assault on a peace officer,

797
00:51:01,748 --> 00:51:04,751
I am sentencing you to
fifteen years per offense.

798
00:51:04,785 --> 00:51:06,822
For the charge of defying
a lawful order

799
00:51:06,856 --> 00:51:08,306
I am sentencing you to one year,

800
00:51:08,341 --> 00:51:10,308
for the charge of
reckless endangerment

801
00:51:10,343 --> 00:51:11,999
I am sentencing you
to 18 months,

802
00:51:12,034 --> 00:51:13,760
and for the charge of
criminal trespass,

803
00:51:13,794 --> 00:51:15,865
because you are a
habitual offender,

804
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:20,180
I am sentencing you to
the maximum of five years.

805
00:51:20,215 --> 00:51:23,632
If you are a model inmate
who treats the rules of prison

806
00:51:23,666 --> 00:51:27,049
with more respect
than you treat our laws,

807
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:30,190
you will be eligible for
parole in fourteen years.

808
00:51:30,225 --> 00:51:32,296
Bailiff, place the
inmate in custody.

809
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:33,952
Wait, what?

810
00:51:33,987 --> 00:51:36,783
I'm trying to make
the world a better place

811
00:51:36,817 --> 00:51:38,474
and you're taking my life?

812
00:51:38,509 --> 00:51:40,959
- All rise.
- You're taking away my life?

813
00:51:40,994 --> 00:51:42,375
What's happening?

814
00:51:42,409 --> 00:51:45,136
Summer, look at me.
Look at me.

815
00:51:45,171 --> 00:51:46,758
Stop crying. Okay?

816
00:51:46,793 --> 00:51:48,484
You have a new fight now.
Be ready for it.

817
00:51:48,519 --> 00:51:51,901
Lawyer: We're going to appeal
this in the morning.

818
00:51:51,936 --> 00:51:54,180
Sir, you can't
touch the inmate.

819
00:51:54,214 --> 00:51:56,113
It's her last fucking hug.

820
00:51:56,147 --> 00:51:57,148
Let her have it.

821
00:52:00,669 --> 00:52:03,154
Get your mind right.

822
00:52:03,189 --> 00:52:06,571
It's a long fight
and it starts now.

823
00:52:06,606 --> 00:52:08,297
[music]

824
00:52:27,834 --> 00:52:29,387
God damn, Mitch.

825
00:52:29,422 --> 00:52:31,182
Who the fuck do you think you
are marching in this office?

826
00:52:31,217 --> 00:52:32,459
What in the world
was that about?

827
00:52:32,494 --> 00:52:35,635
You will knock before you
enter these chambers

828
00:52:35,669 --> 00:52:37,154
or a bailiff will
drag you out.

829
00:52:37,188 --> 00:52:38,189
[knocks]

830
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:43,953
You think justice
was served today?

831
00:52:43,988 --> 00:52:45,955
It was harsh, but it was just.

832
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:48,648
Six months of cleaning
toilets in county jail

833
00:52:48,682 --> 00:52:50,684
is harsh, what you did
was fucking cruel.

834
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:52,755
It is a necessary
message to send.

835
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:54,136
What's the message, Mitch:

836
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,518
fuck with me and I'll put you
in prison 'til

837
00:52:56,552 --> 00:52:58,382
you're too fucking old
to have children?!

838
00:52:58,416 --> 00:53:01,971
Or a goddam career?
Or any life at all?

839
00:53:02,006 --> 00:53:03,594
I followed the letter
of the law.

840
00:53:03,628 --> 00:53:05,975
For fuck's sake.

841
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:07,908
She's a woman who pushed
a full-grown man.

842
00:53:07,943 --> 00:53:09,151
The law?

843
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,257
You know...

844
00:53:11,291 --> 00:53:14,294
there is a difference between
what's legal and what's just.

845
00:53:14,329 --> 00:53:17,332
Not to me, there isn't.

846
00:53:17,366 --> 00:53:21,646
There is the law and there
is the law and that is it.

847
00:53:21,681 --> 00:53:25,443
Well, I got bad news for you:
that is the future out there.

848
00:53:25,478 --> 00:53:26,789
That is your voting base.

849
00:53:26,824 --> 00:53:28,377
And you just told them
to go fuck themselves.

850
00:53:28,412 --> 00:53:30,310
You got it backwards, John.

851
00:53:30,345 --> 00:53:32,519
That's what they're telling us.

852
00:53:35,384 --> 00:53:36,799
Give me one of those.

853
00:53:46,361 --> 00:53:48,673
We're losing this place.

854
00:53:48,708 --> 00:53:50,227
And every year
it happens faster.

855
00:53:51,435 --> 00:53:53,264
I know.

856
00:53:53,299 --> 00:53:54,610
I'm trying to stop it.

857
00:53:56,198 --> 00:53:57,924
I don't think it
can be stopped.

858
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:04,793
Here's what's going to happen.

859
00:54:04,827 --> 00:54:07,244
Charlotte's going
to appeal the sentence.

860
00:54:07,278 --> 00:54:08,762
You will suspend
the felony assaults--

861
00:54:08,797 --> 00:54:09,798
I won't.

862
00:54:09,832 --> 00:54:12,490
You made your point.

863
00:54:12,525 --> 00:54:14,837
Now show some goddam mercy.

864
00:54:14,872 --> 00:54:17,288
Suspend the felony assaults,

865
00:54:17,323 --> 00:54:21,258
reduce the trespass to a year,
you can keep all the others.

866
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:22,707
She'll be out in eight months.

867
00:54:22,742 --> 00:54:25,710
Yeah, eight months of hell.

868
00:54:27,022 --> 00:54:29,231
[scoffs]

869
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,750
So this is it, huh?

870
00:54:32,579 --> 00:54:34,063
The pound of flesh?

871
00:54:34,098 --> 00:54:36,134
It's the right thing to do.

872
00:54:36,169 --> 00:54:41,070
Right barely factors
into it anymore, John.

873
00:54:41,105 --> 00:54:44,281
The cancer of entitlement
is eating everything.

874
00:54:44,315 --> 00:54:46,352
I just snip away
at the symptom.

875
00:54:49,872 --> 00:54:52,875
Have her file
the appeal on Friday.

876
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:54,532
I don't want it
on the court record

877
00:54:54,567 --> 00:54:56,431
I changed the sentence
after one day.

878
00:54:58,156 --> 00:54:59,434
Friday it is.

879
00:55:02,506 --> 00:55:04,301
I look at my grandchildren...

880
00:55:06,164 --> 00:55:08,788
and I am terrified of the
world we are leaving them.

881
00:55:09,996 --> 00:55:11,894
I honestly have no
idea what this place

882
00:55:11,929 --> 00:55:13,896
will even look like in
a hundred years.

883
00:55:15,415 --> 00:55:17,693
Grass will cover the streets

884
00:55:17,728 --> 00:55:20,662
and weeds will
cover the rooftops.

885
00:55:20,696 --> 00:55:22,560
I don't think we make
it a hundred years.

886
00:55:23,975 --> 00:55:25,563
Then God starts over.

887
00:55:27,738 --> 00:55:31,258
Tries again,
if he's got the stomach for it.

888
00:55:31,293 --> 00:55:34,641
[music]

889
00:55:43,029 --> 00:55:44,410
You have a visitor.

890
00:55:44,444 --> 00:55:45,756
I don't have an appointment.

891
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:48,103
Not an appointment.

892
00:55:50,174 --> 00:55:52,038
A visitor.

893
00:56:03,429 --> 00:56:05,362
I wanted to share
the good news.

894
00:56:08,641 --> 00:56:10,367
He made an honest woman of me.

895
00:56:19,237 --> 00:56:20,377
Congratulations.

896
00:56:22,551 --> 00:56:23,656
Thank you.

897
00:56:25,416 --> 00:56:26,383
What do you want?

898
00:56:28,592 --> 00:56:31,180
I knew it was you.

899
00:56:31,215 --> 00:56:32,975
I'm not playing
this game again.

900
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:35,115
It's not a game, Jamie.

901
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:37,255
Hey, on that fancy computer

902
00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:39,603
log onto the Bureau
of Prisons website, would you?

903
00:56:41,294 --> 00:56:44,953
You do have access to that?

904
00:56:44,987 --> 00:56:48,232
I was always
the computer whiz,

905
00:56:48,266 --> 00:56:49,302
let me have a crack at it.

906
00:56:51,235 --> 00:56:52,547
Move over.

907
00:56:52,581 --> 00:56:55,722
Get away from my--
Ow!

908
00:56:57,517 --> 00:57:02,453
[music]

909
00:57:02,488 --> 00:57:04,662
I have done everything
I need to do

910
00:57:04,697 --> 00:57:06,837
to never see
this world again, Jamie.

911
00:57:06,871 --> 00:57:09,218
I am prepared.

912
00:57:09,253 --> 00:57:11,358
I will ruin my life today.

913
00:57:11,393 --> 00:57:13,326
And I swear to God
I will fucking kill you

914
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,397
so just sit down
and let me do it.

915
00:57:28,099 --> 00:57:29,618
[grunts]

916
00:57:29,653 --> 00:57:33,346
Auto fill on the passwords?

917
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:34,761
[snorts]

918
00:57:34,796 --> 00:57:36,383
Good for you, Jamie.

919
00:57:36,418 --> 00:57:39,041
Way to keep the computer
system secure.

920
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:46,739
Have a look.

921
00:57:50,777 --> 00:57:53,021
If you saw him,
then you know it wasn't me.

922
00:57:53,055 --> 00:57:54,471
That's not what he said.

923
00:57:54,505 --> 00:57:55,472
Well, he's fucking lying.

924
00:57:55,506 --> 00:57:57,163
You saw him in the prison.

925
00:57:57,197 --> 00:57:58,405
I went to see him
at the prison to find out

926
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,304
if my father
was fucking involved.

927
00:58:00,338 --> 00:58:01,547
Was he?

928
00:58:05,343 --> 00:58:07,484
I had no idea. None.

929
00:58:07,518 --> 00:58:10,970
He only admitted it once I held
a fucking gun to his head.

930
00:58:11,004 --> 00:58:13,662
And when he did admit it why
didn't you blow his head off?

931
00:58:16,665 --> 00:58:18,080
He's...

932
00:58:19,357 --> 00:58:20,600
I'll tell you why.

933
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:26,192
Because deep down in here
it's what you always wanted.

934
00:58:28,608 --> 00:58:32,923
I'm sure he told you that he did
it because he loves you, right?

935
00:58:32,957 --> 00:58:36,374
He loves you, Jamie.

936
00:58:36,409 --> 00:58:40,102
And he wants the best for you,
and all the things you deserve,

937
00:58:40,137 --> 00:58:43,554
but that's just not
the truth, is it?

938
00:58:43,589 --> 00:58:46,177
He just wants what you want.

939
00:58:46,212 --> 00:58:50,112
He wants what everyone
who has ever attacked us wants:

940
00:58:50,147 --> 00:58:52,114
he wants the land.

941
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:58,327
Option one: I tell my father.

942
00:58:58,362 --> 00:59:01,296
He will call the Governor and
he will have you both arrested.

943
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:05,611
Your spineless,
woman-murdering father

944
00:59:05,645 --> 00:59:07,854
will instantly say
it was your idea.

945
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,030
You know that, right?

946
00:59:11,064 --> 00:59:16,138
He will cut an immunity deal
and he will testify against you.

947
00:59:16,173 --> 00:59:20,073
You will be charged with
attempted murder times three

948
00:59:20,108 --> 00:59:23,629
and will spend the rest
of your life in jail,

949
00:59:23,663 --> 00:59:25,182
which actually
it won't be that long

950
00:59:25,216 --> 00:59:27,149
because you will
probably commit suicide

951
00:59:27,184 --> 00:59:28,910
after your first rape.

952
00:59:33,846 --> 00:59:38,954
Option two:
now this is a good one.

953
00:59:38,989 --> 00:59:41,681
I tell my husband
what your father did,

954
00:59:41,716 --> 00:59:43,338
and he will kill him.

955
00:59:49,896 --> 00:59:51,760
[voice trembling]
And then I'll tell my husband...

956
00:59:55,868 --> 00:59:59,768
that you had his child
cut from my belly

957
01:00:02,668 --> 01:00:05,981
and then you had me sterilized,

958
01:00:06,016 --> 01:00:09,260
so he can never have
a family of his own.

959
01:00:10,296 --> 01:00:14,403
And you, no matter
where you hide,

960
01:00:14,438 --> 01:00:16,336
he will find you

961
01:00:16,371 --> 01:00:19,823
and will tear you apart
with his bare fucking hands.

962
01:00:19,857 --> 01:00:21,445
[music]

963
01:00:21,479 --> 01:00:24,448
Wouldn't you like to know
which option I picked?

964
01:00:28,728 --> 01:00:30,592
Beth, wait.

965
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:31,800
Beth, please.

966
01:00:31,835 --> 01:00:34,009
Please, please, please.
Please, please.

967
01:00:35,183 --> 01:00:38,807
[music]

968
01:00:48,541 --> 01:00:50,060
There is a third option.

969
01:00:55,375 --> 01:00:56,445
Care to hear it?

970
01:01:02,555 --> 01:01:04,833
[wind howling]

971
01:01:16,362 --> 01:01:17,570
You're not real.

972
01:01:18,847 --> 01:01:20,953
Depends on what you
think "real" means.

973
01:01:26,303 --> 01:01:27,373
I don't know you.

974
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,790
You see what
you can understand.

975
01:01:32,447 --> 01:01:33,862
You know me.

976
01:01:39,212 --> 01:01:45,460
[ominuous music]

977
01:01:45,494 --> 01:01:47,151
You're ready.

978
01:01:48,566 --> 01:01:50,189
Ready for what?

979
01:01:50,223 --> 01:01:51,742
To stand on the cliff.

980
01:01:54,883 --> 01:01:58,128
Come on.
Through the doors.

981
01:01:58,162 --> 01:01:59,577
Close them behind you

982
01:01:59,612 --> 01:02:01,407
or there's no telling
what could be waiting for you

983
01:02:01,441 --> 01:02:02,442
when you get back.

984
01:02:47,177 --> 01:02:48,454
What do you see?

985
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:53,252
Two paths.

986
01:02:53,286 --> 01:02:54,667
Look down the left one.

987
01:02:58,360 --> 01:02:59,603
Oh, God.

988
01:03:00,984 --> 01:03:02,364
Now look down the right.

989
01:03:07,473 --> 01:03:09,130
Tough choice.

990
01:03:11,063 --> 01:03:12,340
Can you help me make it?

991
01:03:14,066 --> 01:03:15,792
I can help you walk the path.

992
01:03:18,242 --> 01:03:19,485
But you must choose it.

993
01:03:26,457 --> 01:03:27,942
[horse snorting]

994
01:03:29,046 --> 01:03:32,187
[music]

995
01:03:42,473 --> 01:03:45,960
Let's go home.

996
01:03:45,994 --> 01:03:49,826
[music]

997
01:04:25,068 --> 01:04:26,414
What did you see?

998
01:04:32,523 --> 01:04:34,111
I saw the end of us.

999
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:51,025
Come on.

1000
01:04:58,411 --> 01:05:02,933
[music]

1001
01:05:02,968 --> 01:05:03,969
[laughs]

1002
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:08,766
Safe travels, brother.

1003
01:05:08,801 --> 01:05:10,492
- See you around, Jake.
- Yes, sir.

1004
01:05:11,597 --> 01:05:13,392
My pleasure meeting you.

1005
01:05:13,426 --> 01:05:15,842
Just don't ever hit me
like you hit her.

1006
01:05:15,877 --> 01:05:17,292
[laughs]
Pleasure was mine.

1007
01:05:18,328 --> 01:05:19,605
- See you around, Jimmy.
- See ya.

1008
01:05:22,608 --> 01:05:23,885
Now, listen, when you
get back to Texas,

1009
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,404
you all start making
fucking babies,

1010
01:05:25,438 --> 01:05:28,441
have yourself a hell of a life.
Okay?

1011
01:05:28,476 --> 01:05:30,374
You understand a word
of what she just said?

1012
01:05:30,409 --> 01:05:32,100
Something about our taxes.

1013
01:05:33,584 --> 01:05:34,931
[sniffs]

1014
01:05:34,965 --> 01:05:38,106
Come here.

1015
01:05:38,141 --> 01:05:39,280
[chuckling]

1016
01:05:43,008 --> 01:05:44,561
Actually, I'm gonna see
you Thanksgiving

1017
01:05:44,595 --> 01:05:45,803
at your mom's house.

1018
01:05:52,707 --> 01:05:54,295
[laughs]

1019
01:05:56,366 --> 01:05:58,333
See ya around, Walker.

1020
01:05:58,368 --> 01:05:59,714
You were right
about that chili.

1021
01:05:59,748 --> 01:06:01,647
No beans in that shit.

1022
01:06:03,511 --> 01:06:05,271
Big old howdy to them
boy in Texas for me.

1023
01:06:05,306 --> 01:06:06,514
Yes, sir.

1024
01:06:06,548 --> 01:06:08,033
Ma'am.

1025
01:06:19,423 --> 01:06:21,149
Come here, Jimmy.

1026
01:06:26,396 --> 01:06:27,880
I want you to know
you always have a place here.

1027
01:06:27,914 --> 01:06:29,537
All right?

1028
01:06:29,571 --> 01:06:30,607
Thank you, sir, I do.

1029
01:06:33,748 --> 01:06:35,612
Hey, I'm proud of you.

1030
01:06:36,854 --> 01:06:39,374
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1031
01:06:39,409 --> 01:06:44,345
I, uh...
[laughs]

1032
01:06:44,379 --> 01:06:46,864
Jimmy, cowboys
don't say goodbye.

1033
01:06:46,899 --> 01:06:50,523
They say, "see you later," till
we're in that fucking dirt.

1034
01:06:51,559 --> 01:06:52,801
We'll say our goodbyes then.

1035
01:06:59,222 --> 01:07:01,707
Got a long drive.
Come on, get out of here.

1036
01:07:01,741 --> 01:07:03,847
Let's go.

1037
01:07:08,369 --> 01:07:11,855
[music]

1038
01:07:37,812 --> 01:07:39,641
I'll say this,
she is persistent.

1039
01:07:44,094 --> 01:07:46,131
Hey. If you're having
second thoughts,

1040
01:07:46,165 --> 01:07:47,408
you're not gonna get
a better chance

1041
01:07:47,442 --> 01:07:48,443
than right now to share them.

1042
01:07:48,478 --> 01:07:49,444
It's not second thoughts.

1043
01:07:49,479 --> 01:07:53,069
It's... guilt maybe.

1044
01:07:53,103 --> 01:07:54,967
Regret.

1045
01:07:55,001 --> 01:07:56,589
I don't know what to call it.

1046
01:07:56,624 --> 01:07:57,797
It's called life.

1047
01:08:00,386 --> 01:08:01,629
Most of it hurts.

1048
01:08:04,528 --> 01:08:06,151
But that's so when
something feels good

1049
01:08:06,185 --> 01:08:07,393
we have a frame of reference.

1050
01:08:21,269 --> 01:08:24,169
[music]

1051
01:08:55,648 --> 01:08:56,822
Where are you going?

1052
01:08:58,203 --> 01:08:59,307
I don't know.

1053
01:09:00,515 --> 01:09:02,828
Just wander for a bit.

1054
01:09:04,933 --> 01:09:08,040
I worry about you alone, though.

1055
01:09:08,074 --> 01:09:10,560
You know, those Duttons
are always gonna use

1056
01:09:10,594 --> 01:09:12,251
your fear against you.

1057
01:09:15,737 --> 01:09:19,465
If I can ever teach you
to be fearless...

1058
01:09:24,056 --> 01:09:26,852
Then you will truly have
the world licked.

1059
01:09:26,886 --> 01:09:29,234
You'll have everything
you ever wanted.

1060
01:09:30,304 --> 01:09:32,409
Hell, you almost
have everything now.

1061
01:09:32,444 --> 01:09:35,619
You got the second most powerful
office in the state.

1062
01:09:35,654 --> 01:09:38,415
You got a child.

1063
01:09:40,279 --> 01:09:43,455
And a woman who believes in you.

1064
01:09:46,872 --> 01:09:48,356
And look at this.

1065
01:09:49,530 --> 01:09:50,772
This is yours.

1066
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:54,604
Most people...

1067
01:09:54,638 --> 01:09:58,608
The best they can hope is to
dream about something like this.

1068
01:09:58,642 --> 01:10:01,438
Hell, most people,
they don't even know

1069
01:10:01,473 --> 01:10:03,613
something like this exists
to dream about.

1070

Well, they made all

1072
01:10:15,694 --> 01:10:17,005
I endured worth it.

1073
01:10:21,009 --> 01:10:25,359
Don't you let those
fucking Duttons deceive you

1074
01:10:25,393 --> 01:10:27,844
into thinking you're a bad man.

1075
01:10:29,949 --> 01:10:31,675
You're a good man, son.

Turn around.

You should have picked

Keeping my promise.

Which promise is this?

The one where I swore to
destroy anything that hurts you.

1091
01:13:12,146 --> 01:13:13,285
Did you?

1092
01:13:16,115 --> 01:13:17,565
Speak to me straight, Beth.

1093

Did I lose a son today?

1094

He was never your son, Dad.

1095
01:13:24,469 --> 01:13:28,438
He is a disappointment
and my greatest failure

but I...

1097
01:13:31,372 --> 01:13:34,548
I raised him and I love him,
as much as I've tried not to.

1098
01:13:34,582 --> 01:13:39,898
So just answer the question,
do I still have him?

1099
01:13:41,071 --> 01:13:42,832
Yes.

1100
01:13:42,866 --> 01:13:44,592

No riding today?

Having trouble
seeing the point today.

1104
01:14:23,838 --> 01:14:25,530
There is no point.
