00:12:36,307 --> 00:12:37,757
- We'd like to make
an offer on it.

180
00:12:38,516 --> 00:12:40,863
- [laughs]

181
00:12:40,863 --> 00:12:41,830
Not for sale.

182
00:12:43,521 --> 00:12:46,904
- That should be
your family's motto.

183
00:12:46,904 --> 00:12:50,355
Jamie leased us what
he could've sold

184
00:12:50,355 --> 00:12:53,462
and made the ranch 100 times
more than the lease fee.

185
00:12:53,462 --> 00:12:56,706
It'll be fifty years before
the ranch recoups that money.

186
00:12:56,706 --> 00:13:01,125
Stubbornness is not
a business strategy, Beth.

187
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,713
It's how you lose
the ranch altogether.

188
00:13:03,713 --> 00:13:05,370
You're smart enough
to know that.

189
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,579
- Oh, I know it.

190
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:10,272
And if we still own it
by the time my father dies,

191
00:13:10,272 --> 00:13:12,308
you're my first call.

192
00:13:12,308 --> 00:13:15,173
But in the meantime,
his dream is my Alamo,

193
00:13:15,173 --> 00:13:18,590
and I will die on
the fucking wall defending it.

194
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,628
- Come and work for us
and I'll help you defend it.

195
00:13:23,216 --> 00:13:24,217
- [scoffs]

196
00:13:25,735 --> 00:13:27,047
- Doing what?

197
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:30,464
- What you do:
you're a corporate raider.

198
00:13:30,464 --> 00:13:32,673
Come and raid
for Market Equities.

199
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,851
- You apply logic to your
decisions with no emotion.

200
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:39,957
I respect that.

201
00:13:39,957 --> 00:13:43,512
But asking a wolf to protect
the sheep, that is a mistake.

202
00:13:43,512 --> 00:13:45,997
And you're smart enough
to know that.

203
00:13:45,997 --> 00:13:48,448
- You can have the sheep, Beth.

204
00:13:48,448 --> 00:13:51,727
I've taken all your father's
ranch I need for the moment.

205
00:13:51,727 --> 00:13:54,109
You want to save the rest of it?

206
00:13:54,109 --> 00:13:55,696
Find me something better.

207
00:13:57,181 --> 00:13:59,217
- What are you building now?

208
00:13:59,217 --> 00:14:02,048
- Every resource of Montana

209
00:14:02,048 --> 00:14:04,464
can be grown
somewhere else for less.

210
00:14:04,464 --> 00:14:10,366
The fantasy of the West is
its only resource of any value.

211
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:13,611
Colorado embraced
that decades ago.

212
00:14:13,611 --> 00:14:16,096
It's time Montana
did the same.

213
00:14:16,096 --> 00:14:19,997
Build me Aspen,
build me Breckenridge.

214
00:14:19,997 --> 00:14:24,553
I want a destination town
in every valley.

215
00:14:24,553 --> 00:14:28,005
But I need an
insider to do that.

216
00:14:28,005 --> 00:14:30,490
This is a name-your-price
offer, Beth.

217
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,667
- You have a
controlling interest

218
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:39,016
of Schwartz and Meyer
now, right?

219
00:14:39,016 --> 00:14:41,018
That's my price.

220
00:14:41,018 --> 00:14:42,951
- You want a piece
of Schwartz and Meyer?

221
00:14:42,951 --> 00:14:44,331
- I want your piece.

222
00:14:45,746 --> 00:14:47,162
You give me that, I'm yours.

223
00:14:47,162 --> 00:14:48,888
- You're going to fire him.

224
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,924
- I'm going
to bankrupt him first.

225
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:53,133
I want his fucking
grandchildren on welfare.

226
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:54,894
You break your word to me,

227
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:57,689
lady, I'll do the same to you.

228
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,147
You have my number.

229
00:15:11,531 --> 00:15:13,809
- What do you think?

230
00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:16,536
- Oh, I think she's
a walking lawsuit.

231
00:15:16,536 --> 00:15:18,607
- I think she can make Montana

232
00:15:18,607 --> 00:15:20,747
the fastest growing state
in the nation.

233
00:15:22,162 --> 00:15:25,925
Behind every milestone of human
history stands a monster.

234
00:15:27,478 --> 00:15:29,929
And that's our monster.

235
00:15:31,585 --> 00:15:34,899
[music]

236
00:15:43,183 --> 00:15:46,014
- You are bullying this through
and we will not have it.
Jamie: Hm.

237
00:15:46,014 --> 00:15:48,050
- We will file suit
to halt construction

238
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,984
until an environmental
impact study has been filed.

239
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:53,021
- The Department of the Interior
is conducting the E.I.S.

240
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:54,056
at the ski resort.

241
00:15:54,056 --> 00:15:55,920
- I'm talking about the airport.

242
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,646
- Well, that build's
on private land.

243
00:15:57,646 --> 00:15:59,510
- It's a lease-back
to the State.

244
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,995
- When construction is complete.

245
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,652
- It's a bullshit loophole,
Jamie.

246
00:16:03,652 --> 00:16:07,794
And know this: the lawsuit
will name the State as well.

247
00:16:07,794 --> 00:16:09,658
- Oh.

248
00:16:09,658 --> 00:16:12,281
Well, the Market Equities
group has no obligation

249
00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:13,558
to publish a study.

250
00:16:13,558 --> 00:16:16,216
The government has
no authority to mandate it.

251
00:16:16,216 --> 00:16:19,047
State and Federal building codes
are being followed.

252
00:16:19,047 --> 00:16:22,947
But if your law firm would like
to dispute that, file suit.

253
00:16:22,947 --> 00:16:25,260
I will see you in court
where it will be

254
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,433
dismissed with prejudice,

255
00:16:26,433 --> 00:16:28,504
at which point the state
will file countersuit

256
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:30,299
for abuse of process.

257
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:34,234
Now, the state of Montana
is the beneficiary

258
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:37,134
of a privately funded
6 billion dollar

259
00:16:37,134 --> 00:16:39,343
infrastructure investment
that will yield

260
00:16:39,343 --> 00:16:42,691
thousands of jobs
and billions in revenue.

261
00:16:42,691 --> 00:16:45,245
We will stand firm
with the M.E. group

262
00:16:45,245 --> 00:16:47,351
and their investment
in our state

263
00:16:47,351 --> 00:16:50,112
and I will vigorously
defend their right to do it.

264
00:16:50,112 --> 00:16:52,666
Now, if any of you want
to challenge that,

265
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,290
bring your best
and I'll bring mine.

266
00:16:57,499 --> 00:16:59,846
- [sighs]

267
00:16:59,846 --> 00:17:02,297
This a land grab, Jamie.
And you know it.

268
00:17:02,297 --> 00:17:04,747
- No one's being forced
to sell their land, Ruth.

269
00:17:04,747 --> 00:17:06,611
These are private
transactions on land

270
00:17:06,611 --> 00:17:08,096
in which your client
has no sway.

271
00:17:08,096 --> 00:17:09,821
Not that your client cares
about the little things

272
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,892
like legal precedent
and case law.

273
00:17:11,892 --> 00:17:14,274
- My client cares about Montana.

274
00:17:14,274 --> 00:17:16,380
About the rivers
this will pollute

275
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,520
and the animals
this will displace.

276
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,972
- 6,000 jobs.

277
00:17:22,972 --> 00:17:25,320
My recommendation is you take
this in front of a judge

278
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,046
who does not want
to be re-elected.

279
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,357
- Look...

280
00:17:28,357 --> 00:17:30,325
We're here to negotiate.

281
00:17:30,325 --> 00:17:33,466
- We have no interest
in negotiating.

282
00:17:33,466 --> 00:17:36,262
- So, the State's position
is essentially 'fuck off.'

283
00:17:38,574 --> 00:17:39,575
- Yeah.

284
00:17:50,724 --> 00:17:53,934
Would Defenders file
in District 6 or 22?

285
00:17:57,455 --> 00:17:58,767
Hold my calls.

286
00:18:15,784 --> 00:18:17,130
How are you, Kayce?

287
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:20,133
- I've been better.

288
00:18:22,066 --> 00:18:23,067
You?

289
00:18:25,725 --> 00:18:28,866
- Just hiding in my work,
if you know what I mean.

290
00:18:29,867 --> 00:18:31,040
- Yeah, I do.

291
00:18:33,629 --> 00:18:34,699
- It's good to see you.

292
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,602
- You didn't come around.

293
00:18:41,948 --> 00:18:44,364
You didn't call, nothing.
You just...

294
00:18:44,364 --> 00:18:45,814
Disappeared.

295
00:18:45,814 --> 00:18:50,612
- I have yet to stop
fighting for this family.

296
00:18:50,612 --> 00:18:53,132
I was the reason
there was police protection

297
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,203
for him at that hospital
for two months.

298
00:18:57,688 --> 00:19:00,898
I was the reason that
there was no investigation

299
00:19:00,898 --> 00:19:03,314
into the murders at the ranch--

300
00:19:03,314 --> 00:19:04,695
- That was self defense.

301
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:09,734
- One assailant
executed in the kitchen,

302
00:19:09,734 --> 00:19:11,771
one shot in the back
near the barn,

303
00:19:11,771 --> 00:19:14,877
another hung from
the corral gate.

304
00:19:14,877 --> 00:19:19,365
And you, without any
authority whatsoever to do so,

305
00:19:19,365 --> 00:19:22,402
ram a vehicle,
kill everyone inside

306
00:19:22,402 --> 00:19:23,679
with an assault rifle
in the middle

307
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,371
of a fucking intersection.

308
00:19:25,371 --> 00:19:27,442
- Those were the men
that attacked our father.

309
00:19:27,442 --> 00:19:28,822
- It doesn't matter.

310
00:19:28,822 --> 00:19:32,412
There's is what's just
and there's the law.

311
00:19:33,931 --> 00:19:36,209
They are not the same thing.

312
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:38,867
And I am the reason
no one is sitting in prison,

313
00:19:38,867 --> 00:19:41,697
learning that hard lesson
right now.

314
00:19:41,697 --> 00:19:43,112
- You didn't visit him.

315
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,703
You didn't call him.
Not one of us.

316
00:19:47,703 --> 00:19:50,706
- I couldn't visit.
I couldn't call.

317
00:19:50,706 --> 00:19:52,294
That would labeled collusion

318
00:19:52,294 --> 00:19:53,778
and everything I swept
under the rug would be

319
00:19:53,778 --> 00:19:56,125
out in the fucking floor
for the whole world to see.

320
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,748
Besides, Beth
is always by his side.

321
00:19:57,748 --> 00:20:00,475
and the only space
I will share with that bitch

322
00:20:00,475 --> 00:20:02,270
is a court room
or her fucking death bed.

323
00:20:06,066 --> 00:20:07,482
He hates me because of her.

324
00:20:09,484 --> 00:20:10,864
- He doesn't hate you, Jamie.

325
00:20:13,453 --> 00:20:14,730
He's why I'm here.

326
00:20:21,323 --> 00:20:23,118
This is the man who
took a hit out on us.

327
00:20:27,985 --> 00:20:31,540
[music]

328
00:20:41,136 --> 00:20:44,829
- This man has been
in prison for twenty years.

329
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:45,968
What makes you think it's him?

330
00:20:47,142 --> 00:20:50,249
- Dad says it's
from a reliable source.

331
00:20:52,872 --> 00:20:54,460
- Care to share the source?

332
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,496
- He didn't say.

333
00:20:56,496 --> 00:20:57,842
- Figures.

334
00:21:01,915 --> 00:21:03,262
What does he want from me?

335
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:06,851
- Just take a look
at his prison file,

336
00:21:06,851 --> 00:21:09,060
see if you can make
a connection.

337
00:21:10,821 --> 00:21:12,271
Maybe let me interview him,
or...

338
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,720
- Hmm.
[chuckles]

339
00:21:14,514 --> 00:21:16,067
Mm-mm.

340
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:17,655
This must be by the book, Kayce.

341
00:21:17,655 --> 00:21:19,830
These guys know
the law as well as I do.

342
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,280
His attorney will be present.

343
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,867
The interview will
be recorded.

344
00:21:22,867 --> 00:21:27,113
It's got to be a detective from
homicide and a State's Attorney.

345
00:21:27,113 --> 00:21:28,632
- He doesn't want
some State's Attorney.

346
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:32,739
He wants you, Jamie.

347
00:21:34,016 --> 00:21:36,778
[music]

348
00:21:42,508 --> 00:21:43,888
- He wants me to do it?

349
00:21:43,888 --> 00:21:45,925
- Yeah.

350
00:21:45,925 --> 00:21:47,789
Only people you
can trust is family.

351
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,623
Will you do it?

352
00:22:01,561 --> 00:22:02,769
- Of course I'll do it.

353

Colby: You know, you're eating
intestines you should be
ashamed of yourself.

529
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:27,842
- You ain't eating?

530
00:32:27,842 --> 00:32:31,087
Colby: Oh, no, bro.
He's intermittent fasting.

531
00:32:31,087 --> 00:32:32,847
- Getting ready for
swimsuit season.

532
00:32:32,847 --> 00:32:35,125
- Yeah, cold water doesn't
bother him too much.

533
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:36,644
So he's just...

534
00:32:36,644 --> 00:32:38,749
Sorry, you didn't think that was
funny? I thought it was funny.

535
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:40,441
I'm hungry. Very hungry.

536
00:32:42,374 --> 00:32:44,031
- You want to fucking
dance, old man?

537
00:32:44,031 --> 00:32:45,342
[grunts]

538
00:32:45,342 --> 00:32:47,034
- Whoa.
- Hey! Stop it!

539
00:32:47,034 --> 00:32:49,415
- Shit!
- Stop it!

540
00:32:49,415 --> 00:32:51,141
- You ain't fucking
singing now, are you?

541
00:32:51,141 --> 00:32:55,939
[shouting]

542
00:32:55,939 --> 00:32:58,390
- Stop it!
Stop it!

543
00:33:01,634 --> 00:33:05,431
- What a fucking mess you've
made of your last second chance.

544
00:33:07,192 --> 00:33:10,574
Life is a lesson, boy.
One long lesson.

545
00:33:10,574 --> 00:33:12,680
But you gotta look
to learn them,

546
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,199
and you ain't fucking looking.

547
00:33:15,234 --> 00:33:16,960
[glass shatters]

548
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,999
[shouting]

549
00:33:25,106 --> 00:33:26,176
- Stop it!
Stop it!

550
00:33:29,179 --> 00:33:30,663
Motherfucker!

551
00:33:30,663 --> 00:33:32,010
You motherfucker!

552
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:45,402
- What's the rule
about fighting, Lloyd?

553
00:33:45,402 --> 00:33:46,645
Hmm?

554
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:56,862
Goddam you for
making me do this.

555
00:34:04,939 --> 00:34:09,771
[music]

556
00:34:16,606 --> 00:34:18,539
There's no fighting
on this ranch.

557
00:34:18,539 --> 00:34:20,472
You want to fight somebody,
you come fight me.

558
00:34:20,472 --> 00:34:22,025
I'll fight you all fucking day.

559
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:33,381
Son of a bitch.

560
00:34:51,779 --> 00:34:54,368
[music]

561
00:35:32,682 --> 00:35:34,062
[exhales]

562
00:35:39,206 --> 00:35:40,621
- I stand corrected.

563
00:35:41,829 --> 00:35:44,072
- Horses I know, honey.

564
00:35:44,072 --> 00:35:45,798
We gotta find a way to
make a business of this place

565
00:35:45,798 --> 00:35:47,593
beyond cattle.

566
00:35:47,593 --> 00:35:49,388
- You'll get
no argument from me.

567
00:35:49,388 --> 00:35:51,149
- Good, 'cause you're
running that end of it.

568
00:35:53,116 --> 00:35:55,049
- I got a job offer today.

569
00:35:56,464 --> 00:35:58,639
Market Equities, they want me
to oversee

570
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:00,675
all development
projects in Montana.

571
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:04,127
- What did you tell them?

572
00:36:04,127 --> 00:36:06,233
- I made them an offer
they can't accept.

573
00:36:07,613 --> 00:36:08,718
- What if they do?

574
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,311
- Well, you went into politics

575
00:36:15,311 --> 00:36:17,451
to control the things
a ranch can't control.

576
00:36:19,763 --> 00:36:21,420
Kayce, Jamie the same.

577
00:36:22,904 --> 00:36:27,012
You shit the bed with Jamie,
but control was your intent.

578
00:36:27,012 --> 00:36:28,910
It might have the same effect,

579
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:33,501
me working for the company
that you're fighting against.

580
00:36:39,887 --> 00:36:43,131
And my loyalty is
the one thing on this planet

581
00:36:43,131 --> 00:36:45,306
that you don't have
to worry about.

582
00:36:49,034 --> 00:36:51,416
- Do what you think
is best, sweetheart.

583
00:36:51,416 --> 00:36:54,108
- I'll still make a business out
of this place for you, Daddy.

584
00:36:54,108 --> 00:36:55,592
Just don't come bitching
to me when

585
00:36:55,592 --> 00:36:58,181
there's 300 people in that
arena for a fucking wedding.

586
00:36:58,181 --> 00:37:00,839
- No weddings. No.

587
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:04,394
- Big ones and lots of them.

588
00:37:06,154 --> 00:37:07,155
Good night, Dad.

589
00:37:09,399 --> 00:37:10,573
- Kayce left today.

590
00:37:13,265 --> 00:37:14,577
- Left?

591
00:37:14,577 --> 00:37:17,476
- To Monica's folks.

592
00:37:17,476 --> 00:37:18,995
Needed a break from this place.

593
00:37:20,893 --> 00:37:22,378
- Well, that's understandable.

594
00:37:24,483 --> 00:37:28,349
- Why do all of my children
have to leave to find happiness?

595
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:29,488
[pours drink]

596
00:37:29,488 --> 00:37:32,180
- It's a unique situation.

597
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,734
- The reason is unique,
I'll give you that.

598
00:37:35,494 --> 00:37:38,739
But the situation
is exactly the same.

599
00:37:38,739 --> 00:37:40,775
- It's because there's
no peace in this place, Dad.

600
00:37:43,744 --> 00:37:46,194
Never has been.

601
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:49,577
It doesn't bother you or Kayce
because you aren't peaceful men.

602
00:37:50,785 --> 00:37:54,824
[music]

603
00:37:54,824 --> 00:37:56,550
Guess I'm not peaceful either.

604
00:38:00,139 --> 00:38:01,934
You know what you need?

605
00:38:01,934 --> 00:38:03,004
- What's that, honey?

606
00:38:04,592 --> 00:38:06,801
- You need some pussy.

607
00:38:06,801 --> 00:38:08,355
I'm gonna get you a girlfriend.

608
00:38:08,355 --> 00:38:10,149
- Beth, that's too far, okay?
- No, it's what you need.

609
00:38:10,149 --> 00:38:12,290
- This whole man-to-man shit
thing we got going is just--

610
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,567
- I'm on it.
- Beth.

611
00:38:13,567 --> 00:38:15,154
- I got it.
- Beth.

612
00:38:15,154 --> 00:38:16,294
- I'm on it.

613
00:38:18,226 --> 00:38:22,161
[music]

614
00:38:33,138 --> 00:38:34,760
- You have no future...

615
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,279
None...

616
00:38:36,279 --> 00:38:38,177
Beyond this place.

617
00:38:38,177 --> 00:38:41,733
And if you don't find a way
to get her trust back,

618
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:44,080
you're not gonna
have this either.

619
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,325
And then your life
is, well,it's like your
father's life.

620
00:38:49,257 --> 00:38:50,466
And you know how that ended.

621
00:38:52,468 --> 00:38:54,332
There's two roads in life.

622
00:38:55,643 --> 00:38:58,612
One is you're winning
or learning.

623
00:38:58,612 --> 00:39:01,477
And the other is
that you're losing all the way

624
00:39:01,477 --> 00:39:03,099
to the fucking grave.

625
00:39:04,721 --> 00:39:05,757
[chuckles]

626
00:39:05,757 --> 00:39:08,449
Boy, you'd better choose quickly

627
00:39:08,449 --> 00:39:10,106
or life's gonna
choose it for you.

628
00:39:24,948 --> 00:39:25,949
- [sniffs]

629
00:39:25,949 --> 00:39:26,950
[groans]

630
00:39:34,855 --> 00:39:35,821
You want me to drive?

631
00:39:35,821 --> 00:39:37,236
- I drive.

632
00:39:38,755 --> 00:39:40,308
- You're the only one
who hasn't slept.

633
00:39:41,586 --> 00:39:44,485
- 125,000 dollar truck
pulling a million dollars

634
00:39:44,485 --> 00:39:46,694
worth of horses
in a 150,000 dollar trailer.

635
00:39:46,694 --> 00:39:47,902
I drive.

636
00:39:51,009 --> 00:39:53,183
- Just thought
you might be tired.

637
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:56,394
- Buddy, I'll get all the sleep
I need when I'm dead.

638
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,292
Remember that movie?

639
00:39:58,292 --> 00:39:59,638
- What movie?

640
00:39:59,638 --> 00:40:02,986
- Best movie ever made:
Road House.

641
00:40:02,986 --> 00:40:06,818
- What, you're saying that Road
House is the best movie ever--

642
00:40:06,818 --> 00:40:08,751
- Ever fucking made.
Ever.

643
00:40:08,751 --> 00:40:11,409
Goddamn, when I grow up
I want to be Sam Elliott.

644
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,618
With Patrick Swayze's hair.

645
00:40:13,618 --> 00:40:15,482
Man, I wish the mullet would
come back in style, don't you?

646
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:19,934
Well, I guess you don't.

647
00:40:19,934 --> 00:40:22,109
Speaking of hair,
next truck stop we find,

648
00:40:22,109 --> 00:40:23,110
you need to shave
all this shit off.

649
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:24,352
You look fucking homeless.

650
00:40:24,352 --> 00:40:27,597
They will not stand
for that in West Texas.

651
00:40:27,597 --> 00:40:29,565
- Girlfriend likes it.
- Girlfriend's a fucking idiot.

652
00:40:33,189 --> 00:40:35,536
So, you like to rodeo, huh?

653
00:40:35,536 --> 00:40:38,505
- Its kind of the only thing
I was ever any good at.

654
00:40:38,505 --> 00:40:40,196
- What, you're fucking
good at rodeo?

655
00:40:40,196 --> 00:40:44,580
Fucking neck broke, back broke,
everything all fucked up.

656
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,546
So, why do you do it?

657
00:40:47,514 --> 00:40:50,551
- I don't know,
I liked the...

658
00:40:50,551 --> 00:40:51,932
I like the lights.
I like the crowd.

659
00:40:51,932 --> 00:40:54,279
I liked that...
they fucking liked me.

660
00:40:55,418 --> 00:40:58,145
- What about the horses?
You like them?

661
00:40:58,145 --> 00:41:00,665
- It's kind of more
like facing a fear.

662
00:41:02,045 --> 00:41:03,322
I'm too fucking scared of 'em
to like them.

663
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:06,602
- Let me tell you something,
Jimmy, to be any good

664
00:41:06,602 --> 00:41:09,467
at this game, all right?

665
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:13,091
Ranching, rodeo, show horses,

666
00:41:13,091 --> 00:41:17,198
You got to do it for the horse.
Right?

667
00:41:17,198 --> 00:41:18,614
And where you're going...

668
00:41:18,614 --> 00:41:20,305
a horse is gonna
be your only fucking friend

669
00:41:20,305 --> 00:41:22,169
and you two are gonna have
to figure it the fuck out.

670
00:41:22,169 --> 00:41:24,378
And that's all cowboying is,
all right?

671
00:41:24,378 --> 00:41:26,587
It's you and a horse
doing a job,

672
00:41:26,587 --> 00:41:28,278
trying like hell to not
let the other down.

673
00:41:29,866 --> 00:41:31,696
I'll say this.

674
00:41:31,696 --> 00:41:33,594
When the Sixes is done with you,

675
00:41:33,594 --> 00:41:35,458
you will either spend
the rest of your life horseback

676
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:37,218
or you will never
get on another one.

677
00:41:40,705 --> 00:41:42,085
Get some rest, Jimmy.

678
00:41:43,777 --> 00:41:45,192
You are gonna fucking need it.

679
00:41:45,192 --> 00:41:47,505
[music]

680
00:42:08,836 --> 00:42:10,148
- Morning.

681
00:42:11,183 --> 00:42:13,910
- [chuckles]
Not yet it ain't.

682
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:17,431
- We've established this pattern

683
00:42:17,431 --> 00:42:19,675
where you wake up
at dawn to go to work,

684
00:42:19,675 --> 00:42:22,988
and then I wake up
and want to fuck

685
00:42:22,988 --> 00:42:25,750
and then I have to convince
you that the day can wait,
well...

686
00:42:27,959 --> 00:42:29,236
The day hasn't started yet,

687
00:42:29,236 --> 00:42:31,721
so you're out of
fucking excuses, buddy.

688
00:42:31,721 --> 00:42:35,173
- [laughs]

689
00:42:35,173 --> 00:42:36,519
- Get to work.

690
00:42:43,181 --> 00:42:44,976
- You are the perfect woman,
you know that?

691
00:42:44,976 --> 00:42:46,529
- I am aware.

692
00:42:47,841 --> 00:42:49,946
When's your birthday?

693
00:42:49,946 --> 00:42:51,085
- Hmm?

694
00:42:53,605 --> 00:42:55,055
- Your birthday.

695
00:42:56,677 --> 00:42:59,024
- Sweetie, let's talk about
this in fifteen minutes--

696
00:42:59,024 --> 00:43:00,163
- When is it?

697
00:43:02,165 --> 00:43:04,340
When is it?

698
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,204
- I don't know, Beth.

699
00:43:06,204 --> 00:43:07,308
- What do you mean,
you don't know?

700
00:43:07,308 --> 00:43:08,896
Look on your driver's license.

701
00:43:09,932 --> 00:43:13,452
- I don't have one.

00:43:13,452 --> 00:43:15,213
When I said to you
that there's no proof

703
00:43:15,213 --> 00:43:16,697
of my existence, I meant it.

704
00:43:22,461 --> 00:43:24,325
- Did you know it
when you were a boy?

705
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:28,606
- Being brought into
this world wasn't something

706
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,297
that my family celebrated.

707
00:43:35,785 --> 00:43:36,890
Hey.

708
00:43:39,547 --> 00:43:41,895
I don't want to make
you upset.

709
00:43:41,895 --> 00:43:43,482
Hell, you don't even
celebrate your birthday.

710
00:43:43,482 --> 00:43:46,796
- I choose fucking not to.
I know when it is.

711
00:43:46,796 --> 00:43:48,660
- I don't know what to say.
I mean, it is what it is.

712
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,075
- Then we pick it.

713
00:43:50,075 --> 00:43:51,663
- Pick what, Beth?

714
00:43:51,663 --> 00:43:53,596
- We're gonna pick
your fucking birthday.

715
00:43:53,596 --> 00:43:55,115
September 28th.

716
00:43:55,115 --> 00:43:56,357
- I don't want to celebrate--

717
00:43:56,357 --> 00:44:00,327
- Your birthday's is on
the 28th of September.

718
00:44:00,327 --> 00:44:03,226
Okay?
- [laughs]
Okay.

719
00:44:03,226 --> 00:44:04,607
- And we're gonna celebrate you.

720
00:44:07,506 --> 00:44:09,647
We're celebrating you, baby.

721
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:26,698
- Doc?

722
00:44:26,698 --> 00:44:28,389
Yes, sir, yeah.

723
00:44:28,389 --> 00:44:29,770
Yeah, we're here.

724
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:31,151
Where do you want him?

725
00:44:31,151 --> 00:44:34,706
All right I'll have him there
in about twenty minutes.

726
00:44:34,706 --> 00:44:36,294
Yes, sir. Bye.

727
00:44:39,366 --> 00:44:41,679
- This is it?
- This is it.

728
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,373
- How far does it go?

729
00:44:46,373 --> 00:44:49,203
- To the horizon
in every direction.

00:45:56,684 --> 00:45:58,031
All right, I have to go.

This came over from
the Bureau of Prisons.

737
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,486
- Mm.

738
00:46:05,486 --> 00:46:06,902
Thank you.

739
00:46:17,809 --> 00:46:19,431
Mm.

- See you around, Jimmy.

748
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,426
- You're not staying?

749
00:47:23,426 --> 00:47:25,566
- Nope, I've got to haul horses
up to the Yellowstone

750
00:47:25,566 --> 00:47:28,431
then Ft. Worth
for the Snaffle Bit.

751
00:47:28,431 --> 00:47:29,605
- Well, where do I go?

752
00:47:29,605 --> 00:47:31,952
- Doc said to go out
back by the corrals.

753
00:47:33,885 --> 00:47:35,473
- Where's the back?

754
00:47:35,473 --> 00:47:37,889
- Well, Jimmy, if this
is the front,

755
00:47:37,889 --> 00:47:39,926
then the back is the exact
opposite of this.

756
00:47:41,962 --> 00:47:43,205
That make sense?
- Yeah.

757
00:47:43,205 --> 00:47:46,449
- All right, well...
[laughs] Good luck, Jimmy.

758
00:47:46,449 --> 00:47:48,106
- Thought you said luck has
nothing to do with it.

759
00:47:48,106 --> 00:47:50,660
- No, I said luck has nothing
to do with horse showing.

760
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,904
For this, you're going to need
all the luck you can get.

761
00:47:52,904 --> 00:47:53,871
See you around.
